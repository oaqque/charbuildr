","What do you know, Morty? What do you know?"
4396,"I'm trying to figure out why you would do this, Morty
",I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
4397,"Because my family values human life over science.
",Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.
4398,"Because we value human life. And that's my reason for aborting a child.
",It's personal.
4399,"Why would you abort a child?
",You… would?
4400,"Because it was an accident. And, you're a horrible influence on the child. And because you're stupid.

",Rick!
4405,"I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. Eventually, I'm going to figure out how to stop being a pickle and start being a human!
",I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.
4406,"Pickle?
",It was?
4407,"What's that?!
",What?!
4408,"It's a miracle I actually have a human shield.
",It's personal.

",Rick!

",No! Stop that! You’re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
6802,"Oh, come on, Rick. We got to get out of here. You know fully well that Morty wishes never come true.
","Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't."
6803,"I wish this was about sex.
",You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together.

","Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding."
6805,"You wish this wasn't about sex, Morty.
","Don't judge, Morty."
6806,"Well, maybe I wish that was the case, but I doubt it.
","Me, too. But I doubt it."
6807,"That's dark, Morty, and probably a good reason why you shouldn't date a Rickless girl.
","And so that's the surprise, Morty."
6808,"Because, you're probably a horrible influence on the child's life and possibly the family's entire thought process.
","No, you're right. Where's the vodka?"
6809,"Oh God, what did you guys do?
","Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?"

","I'm sorry. No, no."
6812,"Mm sorry about what's happening here, but it's probably best for myself to just get over there and deal with it. You've been doing so much with portals and stuff for so long, you don't deserve this!
","No, you didn't."
6813,"It's okay, Morty! We're taking it real serious, and it's important to get over here. If you ever need anything, just say goodbye!
","They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!"
