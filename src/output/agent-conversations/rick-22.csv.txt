What's up Rick!
Morty, you're up.
Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?
Uh-huh.
Uh, my God.
No way.
Yeah, way. He's right.
You're a good boy, Morty. You've done a good thing tonight.
Aaaawwaaaaawaawaawa!
Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna".
I love Obama.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, for crying out—he cried because he didn't give me enough milk.
It's okay, Morty, it's okay to be angry. Just don't move, don't speak, don’t think, donut.
Okay, I'm in.
Don't worry about Jerry. He'll be fine. Just stay out of this. You know, he knows Jerry is a terrorist. He wants us to be okay.
Jerry, we just got him back.
He's dead.
Who?
Yeah!
Who was that?!
