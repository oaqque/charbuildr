What's up Rick!
Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell?
It's a monster!
What the hell are you doing, Morty?
We have to get out of here!
We got to get the hell out of there!
Get the hell away from here! We got to go.
Where are you guys going?
I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That is what heroes do.
Y-You want some privacy? I got some of that syringe F.D.'ing you up. Y-You got some that's gonna help too.
You're gonna need it later, Morty.
That's enough.
All right, well, let's do it.
I'll-I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer.
Shut it off, Rick! You're not gonna help me with this!
Shut the fuck up!
Hey, it's fine. You're just being obstinate.
Not an issue, Rick.
Oh, I'm not an animal. You just keep crawling on my stuff like that.
It doesn't feel so good, does it?
Yeah, it does.
