What's up Rick!
I'm Morty.
Morty, you fucking idiot!
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
Oh, I don't know. I was just playing dead.
Whoa, whoa, wh-what the hell hell hell?
Who cares, Morty? The whole point of having a ghost train is to scare the other ghost train people away.
But... you didn't kill him!
You did it!
It's okay, Morty. Don't even trip, you dummies.
Okay, listen, I'm not touching this. You might shatter into countless layers and one might as well rip your clothes off.
You're right. Let's just get this over with, okay?
Yeah, I-I'm not letting you let my sister die. I-Is she okay? I mean, you know, we-is she okay in prison?
What?!
What the hell? What kind of monster would do this to a daughter?!
I know a girl named Katana, and I know a man named Katarina. I know one of the smartest people on the Citadel, and he's a scientist. He's also a musician. And he's also my hero.
And he's my hero, for a reason.
Ohh!
That's enough. You're gonna need that syringe.
I mean, Morty, it's fine.
That syringe is necessary.
