What's up Rick!
Morty, I think we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty. Dreams are just dreams. Everything is just a dream. Dreams move one one at a time.
What the hell?
Oh, God, what did you guys just do?
We were trying to kill him!
Oh no, what happened?
He turned himself in on purpose!
Whoooooaaaa... what did I do? Oh, God!
What did you do? Did you end up getting a new job?
I was told there were "ghost cops" and that's why you don't go to therapy.
I told you not to invite that mummified motherfucker back!
He's dead.
Where are my testicles, Summer?
Where have they gone?
They were removed. Where have they been found?
Good question. Yes, I suppose so.
Whoa, whoa, what do you think of these things?
Well they're both equally mercurial, unfeeling robots with a tendency to misdirect their path, and also they both wear blue pants. I'm pretty certain that, even if I were a pickle, I wouldn't want to be near a pickles.
Well, you know what, I'm not certain either way about either one. I don't think either of them.
Good questions, Rick.
Are these questions?
