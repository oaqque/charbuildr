What's up Rick!
Morty, Morty, stop! You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
Whoa! Whoooooo!
That was amazing, Morty. Oh my God. Wow. Wow, thank you!
You're very kind, thank YOU!
Don't worry about Jerry, Morty he's gonna be fine. He's gonna do great things for you.
Woahh!
Oh, geez, Rick. I can only imagine how much better things are gonna be when your dad stops talking.
Oh geez. Okay, Morty I'm gonna need your help, okay?
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I-I mean, I don't want to shoot nobody.
Who cares what stupid pun you make Morty? Just let Grandpa Rick do it!
What the FUCK?!
What is this, Rick? A Rick game of Thrones?
Rick, if a Rick was killed in a Rick game he wouldn't come back as a snake.
What are you talking about? This is a Rick.
That's not a Rick! That's a Rick, dude!
Hey, it's not funny, Morty!
It's not your Rick! You can't kill a Rick or his grandson!
If we go into a Rick's home world, he can't come out!
Well, at least he can get out of his pants.
Well if we go inside his home world first.
