What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a portal to another dimension. I'm here.
Where are you?
On my work bench, Morty.
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
Nope.
You're gonna need a bigger pair of hands, Morty
What the fuck? You're gonna touch my CRAP! And you're going to get expelled.
What? What kind of test are you doing?
Just a regular test, Morty, nothing.
"Good" -- Well done.
Anything for my precious Morty. I am proud of what's been happening here."
Anything?"
Anything -- Anything.
All right, well, watch me. I'll land. I mean, watch closely. I've got a parachute.
Oh, for God's sake, Rick. That's enough.
For God's good.
Whoa, whoa, watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it doesn't stay on the clothes, which will send it flying.
That's enough! We're not putting it in your food.
It'll send it directly into a future memory.
