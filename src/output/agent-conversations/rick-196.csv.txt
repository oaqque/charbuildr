What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah. I'm Morty.
Is this punk bothering you, Morty?
Yeah, it's bothering me.
You should know those men killed themselves.
They had a little accident. A man killed himself.
And what's his name?
Beth.
Rick.
Morty.
"Beth."
Mulan."
Rick?
Mmm.
Whoa, Morty. What are you doing to me?
Just doing my best.
Yeah.
I'm trying to figure out why you would do this.
Why anyone would do anything.  Oh, my God.

I think I remember the conversation. Jerry, what are you trying to say about Jerry?
