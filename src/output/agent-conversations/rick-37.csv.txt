What's up Rick!
Hey there. How you doing?
You lookin' good.
You don't know me!
That's enough! We need you to do the math, Morty. I know the square root of pi.
1.77245385... Whoa!
Holy crap!
What the hell is the place?
The garage.
Where are you?
On my work bench, Morty!
I'm just gonna do my best, Morty
Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty?
I don't think so.
I think the stakes are too high, Morty, that you're too stupid to get this, and you're probably about to set a world free, Morty but, you're really fuckin' this up right now, Morty's got some stakes in his ass. You know, he stakes higher up than just about anything.
What stakes? In a world, Morty...
That kind of makes you a little smarter, Morty doesn't it?
That makes you an even bigger threat, Morty...
In a world where there are eight billions of tiny swords and a button for every button, there's a button.
Oh, geez, Rick.
That hurts.
