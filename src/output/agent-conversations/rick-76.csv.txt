What's up Rick!
Hey there. What are you doing out of class?
Yeah, I guess.  Well, I don't really have to know.  Hey, everybody, remember me? I was there for a semester and a half and I got a new job.  Oh yeah, I got new jobs. I got an extra $100,000 in a new safe on my desk, and I'm gonna put it to use when I get out of here.
What jobs are you looking for?
Security, payroll, customs, and sometimes wildlife reserve. I'm also part of a rescue rescue rescue mission, which I'm pretty much an active part of.
Are you a musician?
I'm a musician, and yes, I do a little bit of everything. But I don’t do drugs, so what do you say, "I want to keep my mouth shut"?
I say…  Let’s do it!
I admire you, Rick --
Yeah. I guess I shoulda had more faith. But honestly, I think the last time we saw each other, I was like, "Oh, okay, this is it, this really bums me out, huh?
It’ll probably be good for the both of us, but we’re both unsure about what we‘re doing with it.
You admire him for that.
Oh, for digging that string.
I love you, Morty.
That’m so fucking amazing.
Yeah!
Ohhhh!
You know what a great idea, Morty, that was that was amazing!
That was amazing. Oh, that little bit about the snowball collision, Morty!
Wow, that snowball collision!
Yeah you know, that kid with the snowball!
