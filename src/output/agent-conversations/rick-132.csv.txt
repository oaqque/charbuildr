What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a portal to another dimension.
"That's it, Rick."
"I'm taking charge of this situation."
Taking charge of your situation, General. I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.
Hey, General, can you take my pants off so we can, uh...get schwifty?
I'm not your father, General! I'm your manager!
You're goddamn hot daughter!
Hey!
Morty, can I show these to you?
Hey man, you don't know me!
Uh, my manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"
Yeah, Rick, can we swing by here?
Uh oh, no.
You know what? You gotta be quicker than that.
I-I'm just going to go find Mom and Dad.
What the hell?
Oh, oh, man.
Look, Jerry. He knows. He wants that McNugget sauce.
He wants that "Mulan" McNug sauce, Morty.
