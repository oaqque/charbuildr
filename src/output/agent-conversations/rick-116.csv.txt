What's up Rick!
What's the matter with you Morty? You're always panicking, Morty. You're part of the reason I keep coming here. You know, you're really fuckin' this up right now.
You're not helping me with my anxiety.
Morty, stop panicking! You're not allowed to have an opinion!
I know. I know.  I know you're freaking me out because you're fucking me out loud!
Oh, man. I'm really sorry.
Don't be, Rick. You were probably freaking me too hard.
I-I'm not proud to share this, but it's the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.
Yeah, Rick, you can't just turn around and rip on your parents like that.
Well, he can't be allowed to make his own rules. He's too busy killing other people's worlds.
He can't, Jerry! He's not allowed. He can't even be allowed back!
He's allowed back.
Where are we going?
There is no God, Summer. There is no god. There's no God. There was no God in the first place. There, however, there was a god in the second place.
There was no god in either. There never was a God in either world. There can't exist in either place, Summer, there's never existed in either one.
So what are you trying to prove?
That there's a good reason to believe that there's anything at all of those places?
Well I don't believe it's a God, Morty, and the evidence that's not a good place either of them.
W-w-wuh-what are you got to believe it, what's the evidence.
It's not.
What evidence of them?
