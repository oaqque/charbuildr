What's up Rick!
Hey there. How you doing?
Good I’m’t the only one that speaks to the heads!
Whoa! Hi, stranger.
Who’s this now?
Who is this now, and what is it?
We have 34 armed guards, and we can’d put him on a watch list if he needs help.
He’ll need it later.
All right, Mr. President, can we please go to the Ascension?
It’is the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents. But only on Earth.
And what do you think is in the syringe, General?
I say we make our last day count.
I hope you like being frozen to death.
Rick Sanchez, Unregistered Nurse, here to help!
I thought you were dead!
Well, I hope you get better!
Yeah, I guess I shoulda had better.
Yeah. You shoulda been.
You shoulda known that by now.
Well... you can't back that statement!
You can't, you know that isn't funny, Jerry.
