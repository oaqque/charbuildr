What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
M-m-my partner. Morty.
Rick, is there coffee?
Nooooooo!
Is it morning, or...?
Uh, morning.
SLI-I-It's been great, guys. How are you doing?
I... I think I have something to add to the briefing.
I think I do. Uh, what do you think I should do with my remaining twenty dollars?
You should make sure you have at least one decent reason why you shouldn't blow up Grandpa's grandpa's brain.
Why would you do that?
Because it's incredibly irresponsible, and the reason I don't go to therapy is because Grandpa won't let me out of his home.
Because my grandpa left me.
But I thought there were infinite grandpa inside the cupboards!
There's infinite grandpas inside the vat of Vindicators!
But there's only so much force left inside a vat, and I doubt he'd be able to leave without it shattering.
Well, I-I don't think so.
Mm-m... I-imply-
You're probably thinking about it.
