What's up Rick!
Morty, stop!
What?
What the hell are you doing?
Ugh, what are you doin'?
What are you talking about?!
What about me?
You're worried about your father's testicles, Morty? You're worried he might get pregnant?
Mm-hmm.
What's yours?
Are you gonna build them?
Noooooo!
Ooooooohhhhh!
Ohhhhh! Ohhhhh! Holy crap!
Come on, Morty. The storm is stopping!
Hey, man, I know you're young, but you've got to put your faith in the right Morty.
Oh, man. I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
Yeah, it's weird, man
You know, I mean, you know, that's not the way to put it.
That's a three-pointer!
Guys, you're really tearing into me right now.
