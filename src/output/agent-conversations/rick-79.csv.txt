What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah.
Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell?
Holy crap! We're in a whole other dimension, Morty! We—We're in another dimension! We got to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty, so stop giving them the satisfaction and just be impressed!
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what're you doing to me?!
What are you doing?
What's yours?
Oh man, I-I'm sorry.
No you're right. What are you talking about?
Ow, ow ouch!
You're saying something, Morty
Oof! Ow.
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
You people are animals!
Aw, ow.
You little s—piece of shit!
What?
You guys are animals.
We're not robots, we're just robots.
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait a minute.
Humans are constructs.
