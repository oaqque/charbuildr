What's up Rick!
Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?
Just a little bit of history. I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys with a sensitivity training regimen. I've also done a sensitivity test on a sensitivityless horse surgeon, and he said he thought it was a good idea to use a sensitivity less painful than a human surgeon.
I'm not a horse surgeon. I don't do horse placenta.
Well, do you have any concept of what a sensitivity check is?
I don't know. It's in my purse.
Jesus!
I know. I know.  I mean, it's in your ass!
Jesus Christ, Rick. You're really tearing into me right now.
Oh, man.
You know what? I'm really tearing right now, Jerry.
What? What are you talking about?
Oh God, Rick, what is happening?!
The dinosaurs are coming in.
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!
Oh man, Rick! He's in agony.
He's not in agony, Jerry! He just needs to be okay.
Holy crap!
That's enough.
That was fantastic, Rick
You should get that check off of your lip, Morty.
