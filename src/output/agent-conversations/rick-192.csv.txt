What's up Rick!
I'm a pickle!
What? What kind of question is that?
The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
The type that wasn t designed to harm you in anyway.
Oh, I'm not touching that stuff.
Jerry, it's--It's--it's--that's--the kind of thing that separates the good and bad from the bad.
"Good" is inherently subjective. Good is inherently bad. Bad is inherently evil.
Good is inherently asshole.
Well, he kind of is.
But he's not a good boy, Jerry.
I always hated that song!
Good song, though.
You're both equally mercurial, clingy, cling y'know? But I prefer to be called snowball.
Okay, cool it, I get it. I get the feeling... you both like to play the trumpet, so when I unfreeze my penis, you can call me snowball. But I hate to call you snowball, because you're both descriptors.
Hey there, stranger. What do you think of this... snowball?
It's a monster!
You said what's best, and I'm going to say it's "I love you."
Okay.
Aw, geez. I love you too, Morty.
That's a lot to drop on a kid all at once in a row.
