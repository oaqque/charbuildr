What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
M-m-my partner. Morty.
Hi, Jessica.
Jessica.
Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad.
Je-Jessica. Jessica. Jessica is my name.
You're my hero, Morty. Thank you so much.
No problem, sweetie. Glad I could help.
I'm glad you're okay.
That's enough.
"You're a rogue Rick."
I don't know what to say. He's a good kid.
He's smart. He knows when to run, but he doesn't hide.
What? What kind of God lets a child's life get away with a knife?
A competent one.
A man's life is worth what's left to give.
Well, I mean, you can't really give a fuck about your children when you're dead.
Oh, God!
Oh no! He turned himself in on purpose!
