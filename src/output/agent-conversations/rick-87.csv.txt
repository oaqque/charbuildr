What's up Rick!
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
Rick?
M-m-my partner.
Rick, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.
Mmm.
But what if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?
I would have never would have thought to look behind you.
Then you've obviously never been to the Creepy Morty's.
Or maybe you've been to both.
Oh, I've never been in a relationship with a pickle before.
Pickle's don't care about your children.
What about Grandpa Rick?
He's dead.
He turned himself in on purpose.
Well, he turned himself into a pickles. I mean, he can turn himself into anything he wants.
I'm not touching this.
Jerry, take this. You're growing fast. You've been growing for twenty minutes. You can't just leave me hanging.
Whoa, whoa, hey, who's this?
That's Grandpa that you don't want to see?
You're growing up fast.
