What's up Rick!
Morty!
Hey, Mooorty.
Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?
Mooortys are human!
Huh?
Humans are animals. Can't we just endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away?
I don't know, Morty. I mean, look at that. He's kind of killing the vibe in here.
It's Summer!
Is it weird that I know a Rick guy named your mom?
Nope.
Doesn't matter, Morty, we still love you.
Yeah, but I bet she wishes she had the same kind of penis as you.  And maybe even a little bit more control over the phone, if you know what I mean.
You wish you had the cheek to pull that thread, bitch!
I wish I had the balls to pull off my incest porn huffing obsession, bitch.
Oh, come on, Rick. You wish you could just stop pretending.
If you wanted to stay alive, I would have gotten away with the girl.
She's alive, Morty!
If I were you, I wouldn't have done it!
Ohh! Oh, my God! Oh! Ohh!
You're alive! Oh...
