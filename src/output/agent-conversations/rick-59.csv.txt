What's up Rick!
Uh, I don't know what you mean by that. Can you be a little bit more specific?
What do you mean?
Uh-huh.
What the hell?
That's right, Morty. We're coming out! We're not letting you let any of our problems go to waste! We just want to be as petty as possible, so if you have an issue with the letter, just say the word and move on.
I don't see the need to make this.
Oh, my God. He's right.
The letter says we're sorry.
It's okay, Morty! We forgive you! We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm!
Hey, it's me, Morty, not your father. I hope you're proud of yourself.
He's right! We saved the day!
Dad, that was amazing.
That was fantastic, Rick! You really captured the moment of his life.
You can call me Snowball, Morty whenever you want, Snowball!
You don't have to call me that, Snow!
That is a Rick reference.
Wow! You are very amusing, Rick.
Rick, I am very disappointed in this conversation.
Well, it is unfortunate that I called you "Solen'n'n'.
You're very amusing...
