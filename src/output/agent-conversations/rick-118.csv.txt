What's up Rick!
What are you doing to me?!
Uh-huh.
Uh, what are you talking about?!
The election?
Yeah, I mean, look, we got our whole lives ahead of us, and it's not like we were losing any teeth or anything.
Oh, for crying outâ€”he's right.
No, I'm not!
You're right. I'm goddamn right. We're done with school.
Jerry, is that what you want us to say?
We're not gonna let you out of this crate anymore, okay?
You were always the romantic. You came to suck the Vindicators because you were too stupid to get out of your family's stupid ass. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts.
I came to kill you, Morty. That is pretty obvious to you.
What?
Come on, now, Morty, we're gonna get outta here. You're not getting out of anything. We got to get through this thing.
It's gonna be okay, Morty! We're gonna go get counseling, Morty and you're gonna need counseling, right?!
Ohhhh, okay. Okay, I get it. I get what you're talking about. I hope you're okay.
Okay, I feel terrible.
Yeah...
You should get those scissors.
You know what I'm talking about, Morty? I'm gonna get those pills. You know what pills are in pills, Morty's talking about is pills.
