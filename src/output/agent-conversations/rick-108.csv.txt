What's up Rick!
I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go.
What's the matter with you, Morty? You're always picking on me. You're a thorn in my prickly prickly tooth.
That's a three-pointer!
You're a pickle!
Hey, hey, hey! You're the same age!
Ohh! Oh!
Whoa, hey. I remember you. You were in a movie with that guy named your mom. You should really not date your sister.
Who?
You should know that isn't original.
"I"m going to go find Mom and Dad."
I'm going to look into it.
I hope it's not as painful as your homophobic father's homophobic father gave me life.
He won't be alone with that mummified ghost!
That was amazing, Morty. Oh my God. Wow. Did you do that little dance?
Oh, my God! Oh, my god. Did I just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
Yeah, Dad, that was amazing. Did we go to the same school?
Principal Vagina.
Principle.
Oh my God, that is fucking awesome.
Yeah.
