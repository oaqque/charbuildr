What's up Rick!
Hey, hey, hey.
Morty, you look REALLY nice tonight.
Hey! W-w-w--what are you doing to me?
What are you talking about?!
You're acting crazy, like you're not here to win or something.
W-what are YOU doing to ME?!
WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!
Ahem.
It's okay, Morty. I understand your feelings. I mean, y-you know, it's--
Oh, man, Rick. I'm really sorry.
Oh man.
I know. I know. It's hard to understand but it's worth the pain in my ass.
You know what, Morty? You're right. I just gotta go get my family.
Yeah, well, that's a three-pointer.
Guys, we just got him back.
And away we go!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
You gotta watch closely as the dogs wear the sweety pants.
They wear blue pants more often than normal pants, Morty!
I'm not wearing any pants, Rick! I'm not a superhero.
