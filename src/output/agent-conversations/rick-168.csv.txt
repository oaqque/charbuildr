What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
What are you talking about?!
You're talking about my son Morty right?!
Who's this now?
You don't know me!
Oh God!
She's talking right now!
Whoa, whoa, wh-what's going on, Rick?
Oh man, oh man, what's going over there?
A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. And it's not just the smartest ones.
But, but they're all dead, right?
Right.
Yeah, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.
I feel safer already.
All right, Ruffles, time to make our move.
Make it bounce.
You better believe I'm not touching that stuff.
Oh, for God's sake, that stuff's gonna bounce. Right now, listen, I know the first time this happened to you, you're not the only one. I know it's possible that you're worried about something, but you're probably not the one that needs to make the best effort.
That's the impression I get.
Don't worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid.
