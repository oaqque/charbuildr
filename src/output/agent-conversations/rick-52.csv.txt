What's up Rick!
Hey there. How you doing?
Oh, you know what, I really like this coffee.
That's pretty weird, Rick.
Yeah, it is.
Morty, you're under arrest.
What?
I don't know, Rick! I-I donâ€™t know what to say.
Tell them we were robbed!
They still love you, Morty!
Tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."
"In the moment, you increment your system" is the increment in your system." Alright Morty, good work. Let's go.
Ohhhh!
Ohhh!
Ooh! Ohhh! Ohhhh! Ohh!
What's happening Grampa?
What the hell is happening?!
The system froze time.
Huh?
It froze time for a whole day, Morty.
