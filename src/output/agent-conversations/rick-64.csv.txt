What's up Rick!
Morty, Morty, I'm having a little accident. Y-you're worried about your father's health? He's seizing on your logic as if he were a horse surgeon, and you want to come to his home hospital to treat it?
I-I'm not worried about anything. I just... I'm trying to figure out why you would do this.
Why anyone would do that, really is beyond my reasoning.
I was just trying to make a little bit of sense. I don't know.
Jerry, what the hell is going on?
The galactic government collapsed.
Well, uh, can we at least go get our family?
No, I-I don't want to talk about it.
Fine, but only as a side note, we need to go get out of here.
You're right. We're not gonna be see you again.
Oh, for God's sake, okay, I think I'm doing just fine.
That's enough. We'll talk later.
Goodbye, my love.
AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Ohhhhhh!
Ohhhh! Ohh! Oh! Ohhhhhh...
Ohh! Hnnghh! He turned himself into a pickle, and now he's trying to use it as a weapon!
Now, let's make this three for threeâ€¦
You can't leave this again!
I'm gonna go get wrapped up in a bubble wrap, wrapped up inside a bubble wrapped up to the quantum realm of infinite wind!
