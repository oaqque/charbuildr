What's up Rick!
I'm a full season behind.
What are you talking about?!
Yeah, I'm talking right now.
Hey, Rick, can you take a selfie with me?
Sure thing. Can you take my pants off while I'm here?
Are you going to, like, rip them off or something?
I'd like to show these to you, Morty. They're really embarassing.
That's a three-pointer!
Hey! Nice shot.
Thank you.
You two make quite a team.
We all do.
Yeah.
Oh, I get it. You two make a really good team.  Hey, hey, hey.
I see what we've got here for a pretty big assin' ass!
Yeah huh!
You see what a genius Rick is?
Yeah yeah!  Hey there's no need for name calling. It's Summer, Morty, Morty and I got him for a friend.
Who the fuck is Summer?
You guys are fucking awesome.
