What's up Rick!
I need five minutes.
What are you talking about?!
Rick, can we talk about this?!

Morty!

Rick!
Hey! Morty!
Hi, honey!
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
Mmm.
Rick.
You're alive!
Yeah, I guess.

Aww, bitch!
Oh! Oh, my god! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.
We captured that moment, Morty, and you're going to do it right back!
