Morty, Morty, stop! You're scaring me.
Scaring you?
Oh, man.
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!
Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
What is it?
Where is it, Jerry?
We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?
Put him on, Jerry.
Put your faith in the right Morty.
He's not gonna be back at school again.

That's a three-pointer!
Ohh!
Look, Jerry..
