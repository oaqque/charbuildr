What's up Rick!
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
Rick, the Ferrari's in the shop.
Mulan, take off your collars!
Hey, it's me, Jessica.
Whoa, whoa, hey, Jessica!
Jessica.
I'm not your Rick! I'm Jessica. You're a rogue Rick! Get him!
He's not my Rick! He's my partner!
Well, he's not wrong.
All right, Ruffles, let's make this three for three.
Ah, shit.
Well... I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, for crying outâ€”he's right.
You're right. We're done for good.
For God's sake, Morty, that was some good defense.
It was the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.
That was some solid defense. Well, at least they didn't rip their ass!
Oh!
Yeah, I'm proud of what we did to her.
Yeah...
