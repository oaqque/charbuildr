What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah. I mean, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. I just want to be clear that, you know, I know Rick is a good kid.
Good pitches, kids.
You're a good boy.
No doubt. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.
Oh, they do. They love you, Morty. They think you're special because you're a kid, and they know how special you make your grandpa. They even gave me a lobster roll for my lobster roll.
I hope they know not to piss on me because they think I'm special because I'm a pickle.
What are you talking about?!
Well, my grandpa was a pickles! He was a scientist, after all!
And he was also my hero, Morty!
Well done, sir. Well done.
Not my fault we froze time on a humid day!
You must be Rick.
That was fantastic, Rick. Well, thank you.
Yeah, thank god.
It was a lot like that movie that you keep crowing about.
Jesus Christ, that was painful.
Uh... no, no, I'm just laying here.
Well... you're dead.
Ugh, I should really stop.
All right, well, all right, all good. All right, good.
