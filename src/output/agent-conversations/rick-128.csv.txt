Dad, what are you doing out of class?
Taking a long look at myself in the eye and neck and just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife.
What? Why didn't you notify us?
You know, I mean, it's not like I could have actually done it.
I know. I know. It's embarrassing to find out you guys haven't been around for long enough.
Why is this news?
It's not.
The election.

Who said anything about family?
Well you know, my family, my daughter, my sister, my love of cereal, my childhood, my job, my wife, my dreams, my adventures on the Citadel...
You miss having your dad?
