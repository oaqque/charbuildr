What's up Rick!
Morty, Morty, you're under arrest.
M-m-my partner.
Rick?
Cop a squat, Morty. You're not getting away with this!
Cop the tank.
Who?
You better believe I'm not touching that stuff.
It's for the greater good.
Greater good?!
Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret!
Good idea, Rick. I like it!
All right, let's make this three for three.
Oh, well, Morty I'm almost finished with the briefing. Let's make it four for five.
Did he say "three for three"?
Yeah, I heard that one.
Well, do we-do you get a new Ferrari every season or...?
You get a Ferrari every new season?
Yeah. Like a Ferrari.
Yeah?
Do you get paid in pills every new episode of Scrubs?
