What's up Rick!
Morty, you're alive!
Whoa! Whoooooooa!
I'm alive! I'm alive?!
What the hell?
Wait, wait, wait! Whoooooooooa! Whooooa! Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
Where is it?
We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?
Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.
Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out.
Hey, um can you be a little bit more specific?
I think you've just been transported to a time machine.
Where have you been?
On my work bench, Morty. On my workbench, Morty!
Oh, my God!
Look, honey, I don't know what to say. You know what, you gotta do better.
I know what you're talking about, Morty
You're fucking moron!
You know what? You're both moron-
Oh geez, Rick.
You really roll up your sleeves in a lot of different ways, Morty, don't you?
