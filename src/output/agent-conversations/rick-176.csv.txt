What's up Rick!
Morty, we have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty.
Oh, man, oh, man!
Oh! Oh! Oh, man.
Ooh! Ohh! Oh man! Ohhhhh!
You better stop with that. You're gonna wake up the demon inside of you.
Mm-hmm.
That's enough! We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
I know what you mean, Morty, but I'm not touching that stuff.
Don't threaten her!
That stuff will set her free!
Whoa, whoa, calm down!
I'm not letting you let my sister die!
Wow. She's really getting me up against a wall this way.
She's gonna need some serious surgery, Morty!
All right, Ruffles, open to the whole family, Morty
Oh man, Rick.
You're really tearing into me right now.
All of a sudden, I'm starting to lose some control over my life.
Who's this?
You mean, Ruffle?
