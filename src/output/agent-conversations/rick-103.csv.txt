What's up Rick!
Morty!
Hey, Mooorty, you look REALLY nice tonight.
Mmm. Thanks!
I love you too, Jessica!
Aw, geez, Jessica. I love you, too, Beth.
What the hell?
What? What kind of God lets this happen?
We have to go, Morty. The ice cream's gonna melt.
Oh, gawd.
Holy crap.
Jesus Christ, Rick! We're in a whole world populated by intelligent dogs. How could a society of intelligent dogs, cats, and a homeless man afford to shelter from the harsh realities of their cruel world?
They're just being obstinate!
They wanted to shelter us from certain realities, Morty! They're not being obstinated by science!
Oh geez!
What is that?!
A society of cats, Morty? A society of Mortys?
It's a great idea, Rick. Let's make this happen.
I-I think I can get what I want for Christmas.
Ah, gosh.
That is a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
