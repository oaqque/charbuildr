What's up Rick!
Uh, is this punk bothering you, Morty?
What the hell?
I don't know, Morty. I mean, look, the guy doesn't know the difference between good and bad, and he's not one of us!
Good. I hope I can be of service there, Morty!
Bad bot.
Good human.
Bad.
Morty, we have to get out of here.
Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?
Uh-huh.
No way.
Uh oh, way. Overhearing the building.
Oh, way to go, Rick.
Where are the new Ricks?
On my work bench, Morty
I need new Rick.
I-Is that sarcasm?
It's okay, Morty, I'm okay. You're okay.
Hey, I know what the hell are you doing, Rick! You're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.
It'll do... it, Morty it'll do it, Rick it'll help.
