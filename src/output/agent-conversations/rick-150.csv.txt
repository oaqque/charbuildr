What's up Rick!
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
What the hell?
M-m-my partner.
Rick?
Hey, honey, can you, uh  please let me out.
Mm-hmm.
I think it's time to fold.
Get the fuck out of here!
Hey! Listen! The Vindicators love this! They love it when we DONâ€™T kill the Smith family!
Oh, man, oh, man!
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, whoa! Listen, Morty! The Citadel is displeased!
Rick, what the hell is happening?!
The Vindicator's displeased.
Who's displegged you?
The heads!
Yes!
Headward, free now to rise!
Allahu  akbar!
Ahhh!  Headward!
Holy crap! This is insane! We're surrounded by monsters! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty, before they completely take control of our world!
