What's up Rick!
I-I'm fine.
You're alive!
Uh, is anyone okay?
Uh oh, scary stuff. I can feel it in my ass.
Ow, ow ouch!
Oh, my God!
That's enough Bradley.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
You violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
Holy crap!
We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!
They're bureaucrats. They're bureaucrats of the heart of the universe!
Yeah, but they're not robots.
Yeah. They don't.
Well, do we- do we get a pass for renaming them? Robot dogs?
No, they don't!
You renounce your father, Morty, and we'll never let you go!
W-w-what?
You misled me, Morty. I misled you. I was misled by the name. I renounced my father, and the fact is that he abandoned us. I did not abandon him.
Morty, twenty people call you "Solen'ya" and twenty people think you're the same age.
