What's up Rick!
Uh-oh!
Yeah, I get it. I get what Rick was talking about. I-I get it now.
Yeah.
That's enough. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
What the fuck?
You don't know me!
Don't threaten her!
She'll understand when you touch it!
Holy crap! This is insane!
Morty, I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and you just kept coming at me. Eventually, I got it.
Oh, my God! He's right.
Come on, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. You know you really should be.
It's not my fault this pickle incident happened.
There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
I'm not going to regret it, Rick! I'm so sorry!
What?
What's wrong, Rick?
Your daughter is going to die.
You're going to have to go to therapy.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOOOohhh!
