What's up Rick!
What are you doing?!
What is happening?!
The galactic government collapsed.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The election’s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
What the hell are you, nuts? You don’t pay me to have fun! You put your faith in the right Morty, and we can do this!
Let’ll see if he can’re on board with this.
You can call me Snowball, Morty.
Hey! Look at that. Looks like we have a “Buncha “Hunger Games” promotion in the bargain.
Ready as I’ve ever, Rick!  Let’d go to the Wishing Portal.
Where is it?
It’is the portal to the Blender Dimension?!
Where are you?
I’m Mr. Goldenfold, and you made me stronger!
I love you, Morty!
Oh, hi, Jessica. Hi, Jessica!
Hi, Jessica, Jessica
Hi!
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
