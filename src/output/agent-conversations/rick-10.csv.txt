What's up Rick!
Hey, Morty!
Morty!
Rick?
Hey!
Is that your intention to kill us all?
Oh, absolutely.
You were always kind to me, Morty. You were the love of my life. You're the reason I come to the surface. You are the reason why I come here. You bring people together.
Because you love yourself.
That's pretty harsh, Rick. You came to the dark side to spite us, and you're probably the reason we don't have a home.
Yeah, but I mean, I came here to spite you, Morty, so let's not get our hopes up.
The trick to the pickle is keeping your balls inside your ass.
Pickle Rick?
I came here for the lols. I came to kill you!
You came to suck your family?
Well, it's possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren't actually related at all.
Oh.
It's possible we may or may have misjudged the extent of your sensitivity, or maybe my love of pickle has been eroded away.
Aw, man, man. I really like this pickle.
I'm sorry.
Uh, my balls.
