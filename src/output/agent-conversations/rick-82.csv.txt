What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
What is Nooby?
Who is Noobs?
We are not them. They are robots. We are not even real people.
But they are cats!
But I thought there were infinite grandkids.
That's it, Rick! I'm taking the wheel.
Get the deer in the car.
The tragedy of Million Ants. The ant colony that lost 400,000 lives to a giant head in the sky is the one that keeps the ant colony from thriving.
Million ants?
They tried to murder us first.
Then we would have to create a new colony, and place them on a world controlled by ants.
And I would like to take their ant colony, please and thank you.
It's their world, and if they find a home there, I will come and take their children.
Take their parents, and let them go.
They will be their slave owners.
I will come back to them when they are free.
You will walk when they will walk.
