What's up Rick!
Hey there, stranger. How you doing?
Ohh my God.
Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.
Dad, can I get a Snuzzles'nuffles?
Yes!
Get the hell out of here!
You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
Holy crap! We're taking fire from an automated turret!
Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?
Nothing!
Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!
Doomnomitron was hiding here! We didn't kill him!
I sense that you're displeased with the presence of your elders!
Oh my God, his species is threatened!
Well, he sure is.
Well aren't we glad we didn't nuke him?
He sure seems pretty vindictive.
That's a three-pointer!
He's a big... man!
That... That's a bluff!
