What's up Rick!
Morty!
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
What?
It's a device, Morty. When you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty!
Huh, I wonder what it'll do, Morty
It'll do everything!
Oh, geez, Rick, that's dark.
Yeah. Well, I mean, I can't really prove it to you, Morty unless I put it right in my ear, Morty --
Yeah I know, I know. I know it's a little overkill, but, you know, technically the whole point of having a human is to feel superior, Morty is to not need to make the same mistakes as the other human.
You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Take it easy, Morty Smith.
Look, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, I got to get what I want, Morty and that's your problem, Morty's gonna be your downfall.
Take it easy.
That's enough, Rick.
The point is that Morty wishes never came true.
Oh!
That was so awesome, Jerry, Rick! That was so fucking awesome, that he gave me life!
I wish that was real!
Aw, gawg! Oh, gah! Ohh! Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh. Oh, my head! Oh dear God! Oh my head. Oh!
What is that thing?
