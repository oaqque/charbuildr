What's up Rick!
Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
M-m-my partner. Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're not gonna regret it.
B-but I wanted to let you all know that, Morty, I'm not letting you let my sister die!
I-I'm not giving you an "A" in math, you fucking moron!
What?
You're a good kid, Morty. You've done an admirable amount of hard work, and I admire you for that. But honestly, if I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.
If you want to compete in this world, I would be your father. You're a child after my own father.
Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.
Come on, Morty!
Come get this delicious brine.
That's enough. You want my wrath!
Oh!
You want my pride? Come on, motherfucker!
Yeah, come get this baby, Rick! I'm coming for you now. You better give me some of that delicious brino sauce.
I'm coming to get my pride.
You better give it right back to me, Morty
Ohhhh, geez.
Look at that. That's pretty harsh.
Yeah.
Ah, gawgawdude!
