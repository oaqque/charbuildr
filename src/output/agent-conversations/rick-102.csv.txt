What's up Rick!
Uh-oh!
Morty, you're up.
Whoa, whoa, wh-what the hell hell hell?
What the hell? Whoooooooa!
Who the hell is this?
Who is this, Rick?
Don't think about it.
Whooooooa!
What is it?
We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?
Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.
Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out.
Uh, can someone, uh, let me in.
Oh, real quick. This is Rick.
What are you doing?
Just doing my best, Rick. I'm doing my very best.
Hey, you know what? I-I-I'm trying to figure out why you would do this. I-It's my job, Morty. I do my best. I try to be a human.
But you guys just murdered an innocent bystander.
Why would you shoot a hostage?
Why anyone would shoot a man with a gun in a church?
