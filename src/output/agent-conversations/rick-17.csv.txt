What's up Rick!
Whoa whoa wh-what are you doing out of class?
Taking a long look at myself, I see. I see we have very different ideas of what good and bad are.
Oh, come on. You know what? I'm trying to tell you something.  That is so awesome.
Aw, geez, Rick.
Aww.
Morty!
A-am I talking right now?
Aw geez.
Yeah, you know what, Morty, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
T-t-that's a three-pointer!
I sense that you're having trouble with math, and that means that you know nothing about the matter at all.
Hey, Morty! The trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea.
It's a trap!
No way.
You came up here with that idea, Morty
You know what I came here to say?  I came to say the same thing.
Well, maybe you came to the same conclusion that we should stick with the original plan, Morty?
Well if we stick with Jessica for all that is all that, I don't see that as an issue.
That's a good attitude, Rick
You're a lucky fella to where you came from, Morty...
