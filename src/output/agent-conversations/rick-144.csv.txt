What's up Rick!
Hey there. What's up Morty?
Ohh! Ohh!
Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!
Oh, my GOOODDDDDD!
What the hell is happening?!
The galactic government collapsed.
Shut the fuck up!
Shut it down!
Are you kidding me?! This is insane!
Come on, Morty! There's somethin' special bout you, somethin'special.
Come get this delicious brine.
Ohhhh, geez, Rick.
I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.
Jesus Christ, that's enough. We're goners. We don't want you slipping away like that.
It's okay, Morty. We understand your feelings. Don't even trip.
Okay, good thing I saved the goddamn mattress.
Good thing I saw that note.
That means we're not drying.
Time to go another dream deep, Morty
What?!
