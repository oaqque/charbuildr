What's up Rick!
Morty, stay out of this. You're not gonna help.
What the FUCK?!
What are you talking about?!
The election’s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
I’m so sorry.
You should know those men killed themselves.
Not my fault this is happening.
It’ll all be over in a few hours.
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second, Morty. You don’t know me!
I see what we just stumbled upon.
Yeah, it’dn’n‘t the smartest thing in the world.
We should make sure he knows not to touch that stuff.
Mmm.
That’a… that’am the best idea I’ve ever had.
Good morning, stranger.
Aaaaww!  Thank you!
Oh, geez. I didn’T know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel.
Don’ts, Beth.
Hi, Jessica. How are you doing?
You know I‘m proud of you.
