What's up Rick!
Morty, I'm gonna need your help tonight.
Whoa! Whoooooooa! Whoooa!!
I don't know what to say. You got me wrapped up in your Jessica Jessica Jessica defense.
Jessica's got me in a Jessica Jessica kind of thing.
Get in the Jessica Jessica. Jessica is a name. Get in the Vindicators.
 Jessica is my Jessica.
Mm-hmm.
Good morning, Jessica. How are you doing?
Good, Morty. How is your day going?
Hi, Jessica!
Farewell, Morty!
Goodbye, Jessica, Jessica
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!
Jessica.
AAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Jessica!
Jessica was my Jessica! I was hiding here! I'm not a villain, I-I'm just a regular guy. Hi, Jessica...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! Jessica. Hi Jessica. I'm glad you're okay.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Jessica is an animal.
