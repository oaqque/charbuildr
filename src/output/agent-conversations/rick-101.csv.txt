What's up Rick!
Uh, I don't know. I don’t know what to say. Morty, if you get sick of this family, you should find a new job.
Morty, I hope you get to be with your family again.
I hope you find love in your new Morty.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooooa! Whoaaaa! Whooooooooa!
Whoopsie!
That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Wow, I can't believe we hit 70, Jessica. Wow!
I know what you mean, Morty, it was great.
That’s not the issue, Rick! You can run, but you can hide!
You can hide, Morty!
Oh, geez, Rick. I really don‘t want to be on the Citadel anymore!
Yeah, I know. But I feel like if I hid here I could have made a device to detect and destroy any sort of military equipment or even just a nuke.
Rick, I feel safer already.
You should know that isn’uthing that makes you a threat.
Yeah!  Oh, gosh! Oh, no! Gross!
Look at that. You know, I’m so scared.
Ohh! Oh! Gross.
Look, I-I’ve seen enough of the Citadel to know that is full of terrors.
All right, Morty it’d better be safe than this!
It’ll melt if it turns into a giant head or something else!
Okay, Morty's okay.
