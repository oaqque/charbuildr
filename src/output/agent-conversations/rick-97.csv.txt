What's up Rick!
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
Rick, what the hell is wrong with you?
I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm sorry, Rick. I know you feel that way because of that movie you guys gave me life.
That's pretty harsh, Rick, but I guess that's the lesson of the situation.
I know I shouldn't take my anger out on you or the family or community surrounding you. I just try to help.
Oh, I know. I'm not taking my angerout on you. You do you, Morty, you do you.
Don't worry about Rick, Summer. He's gonna be fine.
He's gonna need a new job.
Okay, see you soon.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
Hey, Jessica. You know what I named these? My little Morties.
You know what, Morty? They're both great, but you gotta work on your pitch. These guys are really under-developed. They barely know what a real life is.
These guys are the Cromulons from Star Trek, where they ripped off the heads and used them as a weapon.
Wow. They're so cool! They're like a real Cromulon from the original Star Trek!
These are the best parts of them.
Are these guys? They look like a Cromulone from the 90's?
These things?
Oh my little hairs!
Oh!
Are those hairs? Are those hairs, they're so cute!
