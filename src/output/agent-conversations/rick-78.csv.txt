What's up Rick!
Morty, come on.
M-m-my partner. Morty, come to rub my face in urine again?
Mmm.
Rick!
Come on, Morty. You can do it!
Yeah, I guess.
You don't say.
Whoa, whoa! Look at that. He's getting sleepy.
No, I'm just saying, the two of you have very different ideas on what's important.
Oh, for God's sake, Morty, that's a three-pointer!
Oh!
You two make quite a team.
Yeah.
That's a two-pointer.
Hey, buddy.
I don't know what to say. We just handled this really well.
We did.
Uh, I don't think so.
Not so fast, Rick! You might have a coronary or two if you keep drinking!
Rick, stop saying that!
