What's up Rick!
Uh-huh.
Oh, man.
Whoa, whoa, Morty! What's up Morty?
Oh man. I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
It's scary out here.
What? No way.
Yeah, you can run, but you can't hide, bitch!
Ohh!
Hold on, Morty. You can run but you cannot hide.
Hold me.
You can run But you can hide.  I'll make sure Rick knows not to come back for you.
Can't hide!
But he wants to be called snowball, not superhero!
Call off the nuclear strike!
Summer, Morty, prepare for arrival.
Uh, what?!
Uh oh! Oh, what the hell?
He's right. We're out of options!
What?!
We're not in the room anymore, Jerry!
