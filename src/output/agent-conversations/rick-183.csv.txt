What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a portal to the Blender Dimension?! We're in a dimension with eight legs and sixteen kidneys! And sixteen kidneys, plus a stomach, and we're not allowed to talk about it!
It also has a human in it.
And sixteen legs, which I assume is a reference to Rick's math.
That's sixteen quadrants.
Rick, can we please go to the Ascension?
I don't know what to say. It's working.
We just keep digging, Morty. It'll be okay.
Oh, God, oh, God. Beth, oh!
Oh God!
Holy crap.
Holy shit.
What?
Holy cow.
Yeah, Morty, it's full proof.
I need that crystal.
For God's sake, Morty!
You realize that Jerry's not God, right?
We can't just drop the bomb on him. He's too stupid. He needs those seeds to be his.
Jerry, we're coming for you!
