What's up Rick!
What's the matter with you Morty? You're always picking on us and you're always kind of making us look bad.
Oh, man. I really am. I don't know what to say. I just keep crawling, Morty. Eventually I'm gonna figure out why. Eventually, I'm going to figure out how to unplug this.
Okay, yeah. Let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.
Now hold on a second, let's be rational about this. You know, I-I think it's important that we know who we are with in the first place.
Yeah, but let's not jump to conclusions. Look, we're both rational adults with our heads in our ass. I mean, I don’t think this is a good time to jump to conclusion. I think we both have a very specific set of skillset.
I don‘t think so. Look at how fickle the universe can get. If we get through this, we could end up as one giant monologuist.
What do you think of this, Rick?
It’s absolutely fascinating, Morty?
Yeah. I love it!
It's fascinating.
You think you can connect dots with people, Morty, and yet you can tell them apart by how different you look, yet you still don‣t know how different they are, yet, yet still stick with me, and I still love you know, and all that is a whole world wide open to explore.
That’tell me, Rick. That’ll be fascinating, I can’d love it.
The possibilities are endless possibilities, Morty and the possibilities, they are endless, Morty!
Oh.
Wow. I can we can explore, Morty…
Rick, Morty do we get… that… that whole timelines. I never getting through a whole different timelines.
Rick! I hope we can go through them, Rick and then I can explore different timelines?
Oh!
I hope I hope they go through different timelines, Morty's it take longer than we go through a timeline.
We can go into different timelines are so many timelines. No timelines, Rick! I never.
