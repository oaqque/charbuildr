What's up Rick!
Morty!
Who's this?
You're the man of the house!
The-m-m, the-m!
I'm not the one that didn't want you back!
Shut up, Summer!
Whoooooooa!
What the hell is happening?!
Summer, Morty, we have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty.
Oh, man, oh, man.
What?
What, what the hell?
Oh man, what did you guys just do?
We violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
We didn't kill him!
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait...Wait, hold on a second! Wait! Wait a minute! Wait wait, hold a second, wait wait, whoa, who said that?
It's okay to shoot at people!
But you guys killed our ass!
It was the Vindicators, not the Vibes!
They were just being lazy!
