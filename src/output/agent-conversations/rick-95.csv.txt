What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
M-m-my partner. Morty?
Are you far away, or are you inside something?
W-where are you?
On my work bench, Morty.
Are those potatoes?
I'm a pickle!
What?
It's a miracle I actually hit that deer!
Holy crap, that's better.
Come on, Morty! Give me that!
Come get this delicious brine.
Mm-hmm.
Ah, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, that is a lot to drop on a deer like that.
Jesus. Jesus. Jesus!
Jesus Christ.
Wow. Jesus, he is fast. He can run, but he can't hide.
He's not hiding.
Oh, he's hiding. He's hiding, hiding, Jerry!
