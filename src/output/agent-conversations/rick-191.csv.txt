What's up Rick!
Morty, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.
Goddammit!
What?
What is this, a bot?
It's a miracle I actually hit that deer!
Holy crap!
Jesus!
It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick, you're both descriptors of one another. Drunk, I assume?
Mmm.
Ah, it would've been if I hadn't.
Uh, is that not a good segue into our little discipline cases?
I don't know. I don't have to know. Morty has a tendency to overstep his bounds and fall into mysterious mysterious ways. It's a coping mechanism. It works for him.
He's not a villain, Summer. He's a regular kid. He doesn't need to be a villain. He needs to be part of something.
Oh, come on. He wants to be understood. That's not the way I roll.
The way I play the guitar is that I don t want to die.
But... I want to be your hero, Morty.
You're ruining my guitar!
You don't belong here!
Don't talk about my father!
Shut up!
