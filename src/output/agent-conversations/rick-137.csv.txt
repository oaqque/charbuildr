What's up Rick!
I don't know what you mean by that. Can you be a little bit more specific?
Ummm...
Oh God, what did you guys just do?
We exterminated a planet!
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the vibe I'm getting.
Oh, God, the vibe in here is weird.
Yeah?
Ohh God, my head.
What the hell is happening?
Nothing!
What are you talking about?!
The dinosaurs!
Come on, boy!
Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt alert, full disclosure, full of teriyaki dipping sauce.
All right, Morty. Let's make this three for three.
Uh, yeah.
I'm pretty confident about this, Rick. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!
You can run but you cannot hide, high-armed man!
Ohhhh!
Look, I know this isn't the time, but, you know, if you try to hide here or risk getting shot in real life, you could get killed by a bunch of unarmed guys trying to take me hostage.
