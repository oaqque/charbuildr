What's up Rick!
Morty!
You're alive!
Uh, no way.
Yeah, I was expecting--
A Rick partner?
Yeah. I was hoping that was the last Rick trick, Morty.
What the hell?
It's okay, Morty, we're not touching this.
M-m-my partner.
Jerry, you're right. This is perfect!
Holy crap!
Jerry's right.
I'm not proud to share this, but at least I got to see what a real man Rick was like.
You lied to your daughter about the matter, you big... female asshole!
Oh, my God!
He's right! We were robbed.
We were robbed?!
We weren't here "last time", "last try", "yes"?
You tried to murder him." You tried to kill yourself!
We tried to leave the Vindicators with a gun and a fake name, but they shot us first.
