What's up Rick!
Hey there, stranger. What are you doing out of class?
I'm doing pretty well. How are you doin’?
Good! How’s your family doing?
Oh my God, yes! Dad, it’ll probably be fine. But you should really stay away from the coffee machine.
Yeah, I know. I know it‘s a coping mechanism. I’m just trying to figure out why you would do this.
Why anyone would do anything to stop being a parent.
Because they love you, and if you want to let them go, so be it. But if you wanna keep your family in this world, you can move out and start over.
What? Why would you do this to me?
Because I love you!

Jerry, you're not getting enough milk. This is why.
I know you're too stupid to get cereal, but you're making me more cereal!
Oh, for crying out—he's got more cereal in his mouth than you are!
I’ve seen enough of the cereal to know that Jerry is not the only cereal he makes.
Enough of Jerry, you guys need to stop with your cereal obsession with cereal.
Ohh!
You guys are monsters!
Jerry!
That’is the most cereal I have ever seen!  That’d give me life!
What the most powerful thing that would make you quit would give me a shot would make me quit drinking water?
