What's up Rick!
Morty, you're alive!
Rick, you alive?!
M-m-my partner. Morty, you dead.
Mmm.
Rick!
Whoa!
What the hell is happening?!
Nothing!
Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!
Whoooooo!
No way.
Yeah, it's you guys. We exterminate all life. Except the stupid ones. Stupid ones.
Who cares how stupid you are, Morty? You kill all the stupid!
You do it for the greater good.
Yes?
Yes, Dad, I get it. I get what you were trying to say. I'm trying to figure out why you would do this.
Why anyone would do anything other than kill their boss.
Because they love their boss and their children.
Then why did you bring us here?
Because I didn't leave them.
