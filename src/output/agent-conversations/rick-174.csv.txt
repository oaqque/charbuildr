What's up Rick!
What's your plan, General? I need your help with the galaxy.
Do you mind if I fly it over there?
Sure. Why not?
Can I show these to you?
They're yours. I'll hand them to the man that makes them.
What do you mean they were yours?
You stole them. You tell me.
I stole them from the government.
They were removed.
Huh?
Well, I-I'm not sure what you mean by that. Can you be a little bit more specific?
I mean, it's not like I could have actually done it myself.
You tried to murder him?
He tried to kill us!
He got captured by the Federation and we took him back!
Guys! We captured him and we keep him in a safe place!  Come on, Morty!
Morty, we got to get out of here! We have to get these seeds out of your ass!
You're gonna need a lot of them, Morty. They're gonna take us out of school. You're gonna end up in a homeless shelter or something.
Then you're gonna have to go outside.
That's a three-pointer!
