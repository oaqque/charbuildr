Rick!
Come on, Morty!
Whoa!
Hey, Morty. What are you doing out of class?
Mulan, we need to get out of here. You're our boy. Don't even trip.
M-m-my man.
You don't know me!
Oh, my God!

Your dog's acting crazy.
Wh-what is happening?!
We have to go outside.
What are you guys doing?
Destroying the  galactic government.

Well, I mean-
Hey.
Yeah, I-I know what you mean. You know what I mean.
