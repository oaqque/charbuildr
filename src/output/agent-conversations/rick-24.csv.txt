What's up Rick!
Whoa whoa wh-what are you doing to me?
Oh my God!
Come on, Morty! Come on!
I need your help tonight.
What are you talking about?!
The election?
The United Nations, where every human is an animal. But I thought, you know, nobody wants to say "I'm an animal" when talking about politics.
Well, I don't think you do.
I think you're animals.
Yeah, you think I'm that way about animal rights, too?
I don't care about family or community. I just keep an eye on Morty.
Oh, for God's sake, Rick.
That's enough.
All right, calm down, Morty. You're scaring the Vindicators.
They know I'm scaring them.
You're scarily fast, Morty, they know I've been scaring 'em since I got them. You know, they're just babies. They know I mean it's scary.
Scary stuff, Morty
Oh geez.
Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
Goldenfold's just like that movie that's scary stuff. It made me a little sad.
