Hey, hey, hey!
I know this isn't the time, but you know you can still do it!
Yeah, but I think you can skip history.
Yeah. I get what Beth was talking about.
But you can't kill me!
Well, you can try hanging out and crying and failing to get out of school, but that's not gonna happen.
Well I mean, you're not gonna get outta here unless you're tried to leave.
You can't escape from prison either.
That's not what this is about, Jerry.
