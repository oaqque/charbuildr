What's up Rick!
What are you doing to me?!
What is this?!
Summer, Morty, what are you doin'?
What's this?
What do you mean?
I-I-Is this what I think it is?
Oh, it is.
It's a figure of speech, Morty. You don't mess with time, Morty!
It was a bit. We're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. Some real serious head trauma. Some of which we're gonna need to see rectified.
Not so fast, Morty Smith.
You're fast asleep.
Oh God, Rick! Dial it back a little bit here!
Uh, I think you're misinterpreting the moment. The moment Rick starts talking about his father is the moment that all of his logic is lost to the quantum mechanical armadillo.
What?
That's right, Morty I'm sorry I called you silly! I misintercepted the moment!
Oh man, Rick, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
Yeah, that is a real turn on the force.
All right, well, stay back, Morty
What the hell?
You shut up!
