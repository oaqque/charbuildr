What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
Are you far away, or are you inside something?
Mm-hmm.
M-hmmm.
Rick, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
What? No, I'm not letting you let my sister die!
What the hell?
I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
I'm not inviting her back! I'm just going to find her and, uh -- I'm going to get her pregnant!
Oh, God!
There she is.
Where is she?
On my work bench, Morty!
Where are you going?
To the day it all began and ended.
Oh God, what did you do to deserve this?
What do you mean?
You made me sad, Morty?
Oh no, what the hell did you mean to me?
