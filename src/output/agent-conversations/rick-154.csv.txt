What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a hotel. We have three stops here, one for every ten stops in the city. There's also a second stop here. There are eight stops. Stop at the one that stops at Seven Paces.
Huh, I wonder what the deal is with that.
Six stops.
There's a seven-pointer, and he's got about five to be on his toes.
Five stops. Nine more stops, and I'm gonna get schwifty.
Jerry, stop!
Whoa, whoa, wh-what the hell hell hell?
The point is, the racetrack had six stops. The one that had the least stops was the one with the least amount of stops. You guys had one, and it was the most fun fact-piece of punk punk punk history in the universe.
That's the point of punk history. The fact is, none of you were actually there.
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh! Oh, God, what did you guys do?
We exterminated a planet!
Yeah, well, that's a three-pointer!
Actually, I think the ratio of skill to death is about as high as a ratio of intelligence.
Well, that depends on which dick you choose to shoot first.
Or, you can shoot the deer or I'll shoot the pickle.
You chose one.
I'll shoot both.
Who cares?
