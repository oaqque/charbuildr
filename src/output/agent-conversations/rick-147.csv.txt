What's up Rick!
Uh-huh.
Oh, man.
What's going on, Rick?
I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.
I suppose that's a good reason to call upon you, Rick.
Morty!
Rick?
Mmm.
Rick!
Mm-hmm. I see. I should call on you again later.
Uh, I mean, you know, I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit and you'd still haven't had the balls, right?
That's a bluff.
It's not a monologuist, Jerry. He's a hack.
You wouldn't have to be a monologueist, you'd just have to keep your mouth shut, Jerry!
All right, all right, good. Well, Morty, do we-do we- do we get to the Ascension?
Yeah. Let's go.
Did he say "good" or "good"?
I said "good", not "good."
Okay, listen, you two, we'll be in the Atlantis of the galaxy by the time you reach there, Morty. Atlantis is the fartiest place on the Citadel.  So, you better believe I can fit inside there.
Ah, geez, Rick, I can't believe I'm standing here. I mean-I can't belch on this.
