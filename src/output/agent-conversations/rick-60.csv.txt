It's a figure of speech, Morty. You're a hack.
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, whoa! Whoooooooa! Whoooooooooa!
Hey, who said that?
The heads don't lie! They're just heads!
Who said the heads were heads?
They didn't!
The head is dead!
Then who was phone?
Ahem.
Mm, Morty!
Ah, itâ€™s okay, Morty
Who was the Vindicators?
