What's up Rick!
Morty, you're under arrest.
S-smartest man in the universe.
Not so big now, are ya?
That's enough!
You're being very aggressive, sir. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.
I think it's time to move out.
You don't have to be a dick, Morty. You can be a dad.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, geez, Rick.
What are you doing?
Marry me.
No, you can't.
Uh, what are you trying to say?
I don't know. I was just playing dead.
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Who said that?
What?
Well, I don't think it was necessary to invite you back.
Yeah, well, I know that's why I murdered you.
That was the point of "blackout."
