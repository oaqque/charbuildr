What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
Mooorty?
Rick, are you far away, or are you inside something?
What?
Oh, hi, Morty.
Is this the Vindibeacon?
Are you far, or is this just something I'm never gonna get to see?
Look, I know you're young, but what do I know about this?
Well, you know what, Morty, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
Yeah, I get it. I get the feeling this family values privacy. I mean, you see, I mean the fact that Grandpa robbed a bank and hid in a vat of cash is pretty hard to believe.
Come on, Morty? You know what? I-I'm not letting you let my sister die.
I'm trying to figure out why you would do this, Morty
Because my family values human life over science.
Because we value human life. And that's my reason for aborting a child.
Why would you abort a child?
Because it was an accident. And, you're a horrible influence on the child. And because you're stupid.
Okay, Morty!
Why did you lie to your daughter?!
Because I lied to get out of school and hide from your sister!
