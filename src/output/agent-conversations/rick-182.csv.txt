What's up Rick!
Morty, I'm gonna need your help tonight.
What are you doing to me?
What's going on, Rick?
Ow! Ow! Ow.
Whoa, whoa, wh-what's going to happen to Jessica?
Oh, God, what did you guys just do?
We built a time machine to take over Earth and make it safer, Morty!
But I thought there were infinite timelines.
There's only enough time for a Rick to make it to the point where he can't be stopped. He can't leave his slave partner.
He's too busy killing other Rick's to get his pride.
Then why did you bring us here?
Because I waited until I was certain he was dead. That's the difference between you and me. I waited for you to be certain. That is the difference that I waited twenty minutes between you two to get certain. I was a Rickless Rickless fuckin' fuckin' slave lord.
Rickless?!
Rick, how did you get there?!
I waited until my parents got to get off of me, Morty. That was the difference! I was an intelligent pickle. I didn't abandon my humanity, I just waited until they did.
I didn't say anything! I said nothing!
Well, did you say anything?!
Well!
Uh, did we ever get off the train?
I did not say anything?
