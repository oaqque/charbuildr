What's up Rick!
Morty, stay out of this. You're obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.
What? In bird culture, a pickle is a picklet.
Uh, okay, here we go.
I'm not a pickles, Morty. I'm a human.
That's enough!
You're a pickled!
Get the fuck off the car, you prick!
What the hell is the matter with you people? You're a serious fuckin' idiot.
You know what I'm talking about, Morty? I'm not even mad. You guys just keep crawling on the sidewalk like you're nuts.
Mm-my God, that's enough.
Jesus!
Holy crap.
Look, I know you're mad. But you're trying to take my anger out on me because I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I barely know you exist.
Oh, God, my pride.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I saw that message.
Don't worry about it, Morty, it'll probably go away in your memory.
Ah, geez. Okay, I should probably just go get my family.
Dad, how come you guys took so long to get here?
You came here last summer? We came here a week ago.
Well, Morty we came here in a couple of days.
