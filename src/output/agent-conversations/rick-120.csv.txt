What's up Rick!
What's the matter with you Morty?
You're tearing into me right now.
Morty, stop! You're scaring me.
Scaring you?
Oh, absolutely. Beth is the best.
You want to see what a man can do when he wakes up? Come on, let's make this three for three.

I know. I know. It's hard to say. But you know, Summer is the woman I want to be.
I admire you, Rick--
You know what? Okay, let me grab my whiteboard.
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second, let go. I need to get out of here. I-I need to figure out how to get back.
What the hell is that?!
It's a monster!
Who said that?! We don't talk about that!
We don't kill them! We donâ€™t kill them.
But what about their families?
They'll talk!
When they come back with their children, their families, their jobs, their children and their families!
They lied about their religion! They lied about it! They want to stay alive!
Where are we going?
