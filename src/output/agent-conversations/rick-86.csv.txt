What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah, that's what's up Morty.
What's good Morty?
What are you talking about?!
The election.
"Good" is a state of mind.
You're being very aggressive, Mr. President. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.
Mr. President, what kind of surgery are you doing?
I'm doing an advanced version of a cranial surgeon, and he's my surgeon. I'm also a certified horse surgeon, certified by the state of PAIN.
Is he certified by any chance?
He's a horse surgeon.
He can't be on a horse anymore, can he?
It's a figure of speech, Morty. If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before he's too late.
Fine, but I prefer to go to the horse hospital.
I don't want to see your embarassing, self-aware, self driven, self indulging adventures.
Oh, for God's sake, Rick.
The horse's fine.
Jerry, take these. You have much to work on them.
Yeah, I guess.
Take these.
Are these pills supposed to help?
