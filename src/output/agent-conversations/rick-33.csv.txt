What's up Rick!
Morty, come on. We got to get out of here. You got to do it.
M-m-my man, Morty. I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
My man!
Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.
I love you, Morty!
I know you were trying to warn us, but I could have just used a ghost train.
Yeah, you know, it's not like I could've actually done it. I mean, you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.
It's a trap!
Come on, Morty, you can't, like,  leave this goddamn place.
You know what? Okay, I'll just -- I'll find a way out.
There's no way out of this goddamn prison!
You're gonna have to get used to it, Morty -- there's ways out there. You're gonna need a lot of tools, a lota cash in a lot. And, you've got to be pretty smart. And you're gonna be able to hack into people's heads, Morty
But I doubt it, I doubt you're capable of coming up with a sophisticated enough concept to pull this off a knife like that.
Well, if we go into someone else's house, I'm sure they'll know the difference between us.
Oh my God, oh, my god. Okay, you have to cut it out of your lip, Morty?
You think I'm gonna get outta me.
That's not gonna cut it. That's not a knife! That's a knife, that's not even close.
If you're not a syringe, that syringe.
Okay, that knife!
It would cut it's a syring, that'd be a sygue would be a knife.
