What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a mess.
Where are you guys going?
We have a chat with the heads and Mortys and the Pope!
I'm going to set all their nukes to target each other!
They're just robots, Morty! They're robots!
Yeah, well, you can keep using that logic, but I think it's a little hard to deny.
I don't think it works in bird culture, okay? Birdperson, we're threatened by what we eat, and we're entirely irrational about it! We're entirely rational about it, Morty, so stop being irrational!
Okay, well you can stop being a bird and just be a human, Morty.
Okay.
Birdperson, stop being an animal!
No, you're right. This is just like the end of "Old Yeller.
Oh, my God!
Oh!
You're right, Morty
Oh my God. He's right.
That's not what you want to hear, Morty -- that's not who you should be looking for in the first place.
You should know that by now, the guy in charge is dead.
What?
You do when you're not sure you're certain you're there, Morty is a threat to you.
