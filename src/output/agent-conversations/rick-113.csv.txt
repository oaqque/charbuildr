What's up Rick!
Uh-oh.
Oh, man.
Uh, Rick.
What the hell is happening Grampa?
Nothing!
Whoooooo!
What are you doing?
Just stay away from the windows!
Look, I know you're frustrating me, but you know I can't help if I can.
Whoo! Look at that. He's trying to use my logic to justify something.
Yeah, I get it. It's really weird.
You should know that by now, Grampa has been defeated.
The trick to his math is keeping his mouth shut.
I know. It hurts.
That's enough.
Don't worry about Jerry. He has a plan. He knows when we break him. He'll talk. He loves you, Summer. He wants you to have a normal life.
Goodbye, sweetie.
No problem, sweetheart.
Not so loud, though.
Jerry, you're worried about your grandpa coming to rescue you?
