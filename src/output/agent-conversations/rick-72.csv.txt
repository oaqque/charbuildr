What's up Rick!
Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell?
The hell hell with time and space?
It's all over, Morty! We're in a time loop! We've been through time and time loop for twenty minutes, and it's already broken time!
What the fuck?
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait a minute.
Wait... wait, what am I saying?
I think you're looking at the stars in the sky right now.
Huh, that's weird.
Oh, no, I think you've figured it out.
Hey, wait a minute, wait wait, hold on a second, Morty. The house is completely white. You don't have to worry about it. The cats are completely white and all over your windows!
Oh! Oh, man, oh, man!
I'm colorblind. I can't see the cats or the people I'm standing around in the street light. It's like I'm color blind.
Holy crap!
Are you kidding me?
Look, I can see the stars!
Holy shit!
Look at that. Wow. I don't know if I can.
Look! Look at that sun! It's bright.
Wow. This is insane.
