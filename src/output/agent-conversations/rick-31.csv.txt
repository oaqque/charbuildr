I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
Morty!
He's not my Rick! He's my partner!
Boo-yah!
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoooooooa! Who's this now?
What the hell hell hell?
That's my sister.
Who's this Morty?
Who the hell is Noob-Noob?
Hey, it's me, Jessica.
Hey.
You know, Jessica?
Jessica.
Jessica?
Noob-Nob.
Huh?
I'm Jessica. I remember you. You were a good kid. You should be doing great things.
Yeah, I do. I should get going anyway.
What? What kind of monster are you?
You're a horrible influence on my life. I'm going to go to therapy.
