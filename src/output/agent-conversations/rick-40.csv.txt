What's up Rick!
I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. Eventually, I'm going to figure out how to stop being a pickle and start being a human!
Pickle?
What's that?!
It's a miracle I actually have a human shield.
Morty, do you have a song?!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaah! Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhhh!
Don't worry about Rick, Summer. He's gonna be fine.
Don’t worry about Jerry, Summer, he’s gonna be okay.
Ohhhh!
He’ll be fine!
Woahh! Oh! He’m… he”s gonna’be fine! We’re so screwed!
No way.
Yeah, way.  You see, that was the plan, Rick.
Mission accomplished.
I see what we did there. We spared no expenses. And we spared no expense.
That’d be a huge mistake, Rick! We saved a life!
We saved a fucking life! We spared a life?!?!?!
We spared a fucking tragedy?!?! We spared the Rick!?!?! That’ve spared a tragedy?!
