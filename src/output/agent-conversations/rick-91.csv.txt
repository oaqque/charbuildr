What's up Rick!
Morty, Morty, stop! You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
Oh, man.
The heads love this! They love it when we DON’T kill the Smith family!
Holy shit!
I love this family! They are so supportive of our daughter!
Smith family?
Yeah, I’m pretty sure he works for the government.
Yeah?
I see what we’ve got here and we‘re gonna go get him.
Get him?
Get what?
The head?
We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple Rick’s mind. It plays a hologram of Rick singing a bunch of his songs. It’ll play a holographic sound effect when he wakes up.
What do you mean you guys wake up?
Mm…
M-m-my God.
Oh man, oh, man! Oh, man, man
Ohh! Oh! Ohh!
What’a! What happened?
He turned himself into a pickle.
