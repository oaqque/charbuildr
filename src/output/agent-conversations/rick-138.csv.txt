What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
What are you talking about?!
You're talking about my Rick! You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You should know that by now!
Morty, you're a full season behind.
What?
Our Rick is our Jessica.
Mm-hmm.
And so that's the surprise, Morty.
Well, I mean, look, I got him in a lot of trouble earlier this week, and I was kinda hoping that I could help him out with something.
Oh, for crying outâ€”he doesn't care about anyone but himself.  He's a pickle!
Well he doesn't need to be mean. He can be a pal.
I'm not saying that.
You shouldn't threaten him.
Look, I'm not putting my father in a home! He's obviously not capable of judging these situations, and if he wants to stay out of it, he can, but I'm pretty sure he won't.
Whoa, whoa, stay calm, Morty, if you're gonna hurt someone, don't threaten her!
You should know the consequences of anything you do, Morty
You know what? I'm putting my dad in a vat of lead wire and a bunch of lead strips wrapped around him like a pair of scissors.
Okay, hold tight.
Alright, hold on a second, Morty I'm gonna pull my hair out.
Rick, hold me. Hold on a minute. Hold tight. Hold me.
