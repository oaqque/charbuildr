What's up Rick!
I-I need five minutes.
Morty!
Rick?
Hey, look, I'm late to class because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.
It's okay, Morty. I understand your feelings. I'm sorry about what's happened to you.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Is anyone okay?
Look, I know I shouldn't take my anger out on you or the family or the school or the city but the fact that you're acting like this is really shows just how insufferable you are.
Jerry, take your anger out of your family. You're a good kid, Morty, but you're not the type to take your own advice on anything.
You should know that by now, Jerry, the only way you can get away with anything is if it involves something you want to hide.
Oh, God!
Oh my God! Oh, my God. He's trying to tell us something.
Don't judge, Morty!
Look at that. That's not even mildew.
Ahem! Gross!
Yeah, Morty that's a three-pointer!
That's enough!
You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Don't even trip about your pants.
Okay, dad, just take your pants off. You know you're really special because you're special.
That means you're the Worldender and that means nothing to us.
