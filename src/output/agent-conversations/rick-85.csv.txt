What's up Rick!
Whoa wh-what are you doing?
What are you doin'?
What is this place?
It's a portal to the Blender Dimension?! From what I can tell, you're transported to a much smaller and strangerier place.
Very amusing, Mr. President. Fun's over.
No, you can't.
But I can make it bounce.
Sure thing, Rick! But can you make it travel through dreams?
Sure! Let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.
I don't want to be late. This is gonna be good.
Oh, for God's sake, Rick. I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
What?!
What the hell?
The point is he crossed the street and started digging around.
Holy crap.
Jesus Christ.
Look, there's a young lady in the crowd. Hi, stranger.
Hey, stranger, stranger!
Hey!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
