What's up Rick!
What are you doing to me?!
Morty, take off your collars!
Oh, I'm sorry. I know you're mad at me because you love me. But if you love your daughter so much why don't you marry her?
I love you too, Jessica!
Holy crap!
Hey, Jessica.
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Morty. I mean, I know it's hard to understand but you know, sometimes, you gotta stick with what youre got.
Hey man, Morty, I appreciate the help. I appreciate it. But honestly, if you want to keep going with the adventure, you got to put some serious work in.
Yeah, Rick, I was kinda hoping that one of you would show up.
Oh man, I can't believe we missed you so much.
Aww, Jessica, I missed you.
You know what? I was really hoping that someone would show you up. Oh, man, Rick.
Aw, man.
Look, I really liked her.
Jessica.
Whoa, Jessica...
Who?
Oh geez, Jessica?
Jessica!
