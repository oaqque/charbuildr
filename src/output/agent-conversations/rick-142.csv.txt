What's up Rick!
I'm a pickle!
Whoa!
Ohhhh!
Aaaaah!
Ahhhh! Ohhhhhh!
That was amazing, Morty. Ohhh my God. Wow. Wow, I'm not proud.
Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.
It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. You do what's best for the little guy.
You do what I say, Morty! I do what you say!
You're a real Julius Caesar.
And you're a fucking moron, Morty
You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together.
Well, you know, I mean, I get the feeling that Jerry and Beth are very different people.
But Beth is a lucky fella.
Jerry, I wish this would have been about sex.
No way.
I hope you get better.
Yeah, I know that's why I came here.
That's why you came here, that's how I came to hate you.
Because I came in here. That's how you came to love you. That is how you come to hate me.
