What's up Rick!
Morty, stop! You're scaring me.
M-m-my partner. Morty, you're scarily close to death.
W-what?
He's saying we should get ready to fight.
Scary stuff, huh?
Oh, no, what did you guys just do?
We ripped our pants off and weinerized them!
What? What happened?
Nothing! We exterminated a planet!
Nothing?! We exterminate a superhero?!
What the hell?
Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?
You're a little too young, Morty. He's only six months.
What?!
Oh my God! He turned himself into a pickle!
You turned yourself into a snake!
He turned himself back into a human?
Uh, no?
I didn't say he did!
Uh oh, my God, he did.
