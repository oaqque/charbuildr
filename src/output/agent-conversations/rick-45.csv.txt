What's up Rick!
Morty, I need your help tonight.
Whoa! Whooooooa!
Hey, wait, hold on a second, Morty. You don't know me!
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
You don't either, Morty!
I need your powers! Get in the cupboards!
Oh, I'm Mr. President. You're the man of the house!
Yeah, but I mean, you're not the one that didn't want you back.
That's not the issue, Rick! We have a giant mattress under my bed that I keep in my memory because I was sleeping on it all the time.
Well, duh doy, son. Do you remember the conversation?
Who's this now?
The President?
I don't remember the details of the briefing. I was there, and we talked about it. I don't think it was very nice.
Hi, President.
You should know that by now, we have learned that the United Nations are run by intelligent, charismatic people. We don't need your politics. We have an active defense force. We can send our children to fight Hitler, the Cromulons, the Blobots, or the Cromunists.
I'm President, not a dick.
Hey!
You're right!
This is the President. We're not Hitler!
We're not a Hitler, this is a Hitler.
