What's up Rick!
Morty, twenty people enter, twenty paces leave.  I'm not proud to share this, but twenty people stand by me. I mean, look at how many paces they stand by you. It's insane.
What the hell?
That's twenty-nine people.
Well, do we- do we—do we get a big rock? Or--
For God’s sake, Morty, what the hell is wrong with you people getting so excited to see your dad go out and buy a Ferrari?
He got captured by the Federation and we wanted to take him back so we could take him with-with us?
Yeah, well, I-I-I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.
Mm-my grandpa was captured by aliens, and we captured him back to him. I captured him because he was the most fascinating thing about my life.
You captured him for me, Morty. You captured him from the inside. You better believe I'm going to go out there and get a real nice suit.
Oh, man, Rick. You know what? That was fantastic.
It was?
Oh man, Morty! That was amazing.
Yeah.
That was amazing, Rick! You should see a doctor.
He died instantly.
Did he die?
Uh, no?
No, no, no!
No!
He just went into a dimension with no evidence.
