What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah, I was there.
You must be Rick.
I was there, too. I was right behind you.
That's it, Morty. We're goners. We don't talk about getting shot. We get high and run around in a yellow t-shirt all the time. It's really weird.
Hey, it's you guys, the Vindicators. Were you at our house party a lot this weekend?
We were robbed.
Huh?
Our home world is run by intelligent design. It was our home before we were split.
But the Vin-Is that the Vibes?
I sense that you're displeased with your elders. Perhaps I should call upon you to clean up their kingdom.
Rick, tell them your kingdom is run in a very unfeeling ghost train.
Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."
"It's not the system that's keeping the system up, Rick."
It's the system, Morty!
That Morty, is why we don't freeze time, you dumb!
If it takes longer than 40 years, our problem will solve itself!
It takes longer, Morty, we're not drying time.
It'll take longer than that!
Oh, geez, I'm so sorry.
