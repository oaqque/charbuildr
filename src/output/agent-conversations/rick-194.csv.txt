What's up Rick!
Uh, I'm not your Rick.
What? What kind of God lets this happen?
The kind that lets the dogs out of the crate when we least expect it!
So, you're the Smith family's Rick and Beth. I-I'm not the one that didn't want you back.
Smith family?
I'm the one who stabbed you!
Who?
Yeah, you know what? I-It's hard to remember because I barely have a memory of my own life. But, hey, at least I got to see Grandpa play guitar.
And Summer, right?
And Beth?
We never even talked about it.
The Smith family, ladies and gentleman.
Whoa! Hi, Jessica.
Hi, Jessica!
You look REALLY nice tonight.
You know what I want you to do with them.
I know what you want you do with her!
I will do it for me.
Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh! Ohh! Ohhhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhh!
