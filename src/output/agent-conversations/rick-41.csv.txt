What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
What are you talking about?!
You're talking about my Rick! You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty. You're as dumb as a bag of sand.
You wish this was about fucking dumb people, not stupid babies.
Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.
It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!
We froze time so you could clean the house!
It was humid!
Morty, come on, Morty! The moisture in this cup is triggering me.
M-m-my partner.
Is that what you want us to say?
I don't want you slipping away like that!
Ohh! Ohh!
The coffee machine!
You know what? It's working!
Ooh, nice, thanks for killing Worldender!
No problem, Morty
Ohhh! Oh, thank you, Rick.
No, thank YOU!
That was Worldender.
