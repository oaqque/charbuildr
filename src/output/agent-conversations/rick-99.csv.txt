What's up Rick!
Morty, you're alive!
W-where are you?
On my work bench, Morty.
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
It's a miracle I actually see you there, Morty!
Whoa! Hey, stranger! What do you think of these things?
They're both great, Morty, but the fact is, I just kept crawling, Morty... I kept crawling.
Oh, man.
Rick, you really are a pickle.
Yeah, Rick, it's great to be on the same page every once in a while.
You know, I mean, you know, these things really bring it all together.
This is a great adventure, Morty
For everybody.
For everyone.
I love you guys.
It really makes you appreciate how important Rick is.
He really is.  That's why I choose to go to therapy.
That's a three-pointer!
He's a golden example of what a man should do.
Let's do this, Morty? I mean-I mean, we got to get to the point where we're both rational adults that sometimes feel stupid and sometimes, sometimes...
