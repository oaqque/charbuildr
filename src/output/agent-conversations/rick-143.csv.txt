What's up Rick!
Morty, come on!
Oh, man. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Rick.
Ohh, man, ohh man, he's right.
Come on, Morty. You know what? He bailed on you before the series even began. He knows how it felt.
Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony that Rick found in the garage was the most powerful in the galaxy. It was the will of all the Ants that Rick defeated!
Rick, why are you acting like that's not you?!
Mm-hmm.
Whoa, whoa, Morty, you're acting crazy. I know it's not your fault we hit the deer!
Who cares? We kill them every week.
Why are you freaking mad at me?
M-m-my God, Morty!
You're freaking me out!
Holy crap!
That's enough! We're taking fire from an automated turret!
Take cover, Morty
Hey, there's no need for any more fire!
Hey there, there, Morty what do you know about that?
Nothing!
Well, Morty it's okay to shoot through windows, but I'm pretty sure you're not touching them!
I'm pretty close to death!
