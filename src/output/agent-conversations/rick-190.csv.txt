What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah.
Uh huh.
Rick what the hell is wrong with you?
I don't know. I just kept crawling, and I kept dying.
Look, I know you're young, but you've got to get used to it. It gets a little tedious after a while.
Oh, geez, Rick. I-I don’t know what to say. I got so much to lose.
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, it’s possible that your faith in humanity has eroded over time and your perception of reality has eroded.
Damn it!
I-I-Is this what I think it is?
It's a trap!
Come on, Morty. You know I can't.
Whoa, whoa, Morty! The trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea.
Hey, who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
You're the man of the house now! Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!
Ohh!
Holy crap, Rick! The house is completely trashed. All the windows are gone.
What?
Oh man, oh, man, what did you guys do?
We froze time and everything. Everything but the time crystal clear sky is gone. Everything is still there, it's just a dream inside my head.
I mean, it froze time inside my brain, and everything inside my mouth.
