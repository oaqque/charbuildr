What's up Rick!
Uh-oh.
Morty, I'm seeing more croc than human here.
That's enough! We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm!
M-m-my partner.
Rick, you have a new mission.
Vindicators, prepare for arrival.
Ow! Ow!
Rick!
Aah!
Oof! Ow.
Yeah, I know. I know how to vacuum. I vacuum Mom and Dad. I've been doing it for six months!
Oh, my God!
Holy crap! Therapists, get better!
No!
It's okay, Morty. You're okay.
You're okay!
You were right! We were wrong! We both were right!!
Oh man, oh, man, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
Hey, Morty! Look at this guy go. He's smart. He knows we can do everything.
He knows we could do better! We could put him on a watch list or something.
