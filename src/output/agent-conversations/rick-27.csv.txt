What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a trap!
Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here!
I-I-Is that sarcasm?! Come on, Rick. You know you really should be taking this to heart.
Come to the party! We got a surprise for you Morty. Come on in.
Oh, for crying outâ€”he's got a parachute.
He's not gonna be seen the whole time, honey. Come to the surprise, Morty!
He can't be seen if he's not here. Come here! Come here.
What the hell?
Ohhhh, he-he's here. Hi, honey!
Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh. Hi! Ohhhh!
Hey, honey, ohhhh! Ohhh! Ohh!
Look, I'm sorry. Oh, my God. He's in agony.
Holy crap.
Jesus...
Holy shit.
Yeah, I know. I know that feel.  That means we're not drying.
Good thing I saw the note.
I know you're drying. You're probably a lucky fella to have found a grape.
That's enough, sweetie.
