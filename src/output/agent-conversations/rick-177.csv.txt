What's up Rick!
Morty, you're under arrest.
S-smartest man in the universe.
Not so big now, are ya?
That's enough!
That was fantastic, Rick! You should be careful with that.
That’s enough! We’re not touching that!!
We’ve got enough! Drop the gun, Rick.
This is the President.
We should pack up and leave town now.
I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.
What the hell is happening Grampa?
I see we have a standoff here.
Yeah, but I think that was the point of freezing time, you guys. It makes no sense.
You guys need to freeze time. It’ll make no sense!
I know.  That’d’be the point.  We froze time so we could get to our family on a Blackhawk and then dumber it to zero emissions.
Ah, God!
No, no, no! Bad! Bad!!
The heads are angry!
The head is displeased!
Not all of us!
