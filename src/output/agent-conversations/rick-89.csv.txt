What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick? W-where are you?
On my work bench, Morty!
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
Oh, man.
Look, I know you're frustrating me, but Morty's not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb...
Oh man, oh, man, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare you.
What the hell are you doing?
What?
I'm trying to tell you something.
Dad, what the hell is wrong with you? You're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.
You're trying to impress me with your dumb jokes, Morty. You're really putting them to use this one.
Ohh!
Ohhhh!
You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!
What's wrong with him?
He's a pickle!
Come on, Morty, don't stay back. You can run but you're not gonna hide!
Look! A pickle is fine as long as it is on a mattress.
It's fine as a human being.
