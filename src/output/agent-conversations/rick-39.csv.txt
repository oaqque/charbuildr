What's up Rick!
Hey there, stranger. What are you doing out of class?
I don't know yet. I have to do it. I mean, look, I'm a scientist. I'm passionate about anything. Even if it's just a theoretical thing.
Anything’s possible, Rick! I mean look at that.
Oh, for God’d sake, Rick. He’m really getting schwifty tonight.
All right, Morty. Let’t do it!
Ohhhhhh!
It’ll be great, Morty!
That’a’am amazing, Morty, and you should thank him for it.
Yeah, I’ve seen it happen, it’is what it is to you.
It really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can get.
You should thank Rick Sanchez for that. He saved my life.
I hope you get to be okay with school.
That was fantastic, Morty
I liked it! I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun!
Yeah. That was fantastic.
No doubt.
Yes, I bet it was. Thank you. Yes, Nathan, you were a huge influence on the whole family.
Thanks for having such a supportive Dad.
Sure do me a favor.
Well, Morty do—yes, Nathan. I hope I get to go somewhere nice.
