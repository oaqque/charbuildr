What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah.
What's this place?
It's a trap!
Come on, Morty. You got to put these on.
Come get these delicious brine.
Oh, man.
I'm not letting you let my sister die!
Oh man. She's gonna die.
Woahh!
Man, Rick, that's dark.
Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here.
Morty, you're up.
Not so fast, Morty!
SLI-I-Is that a threat?
Not with that attitude.
Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?
Nope.
Uh-oh!
No, thanks, I'm okay.
You're better.
