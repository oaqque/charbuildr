What's up Rick!
Uh, my God.
Morty!
Rick?
Hey, it's Rick. What do you think of this?
M-m-my God. He's right. We're goners. Morty, stop killing people!
Mmm.
You should know those men killed themselves.
I don't like it here! I-I-I'm sorry.
Why am I still here?
Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty.
Oh, God! What did you guys do?
We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.
Because you're irrational, and we don't want you back!
Because my dog crate says it's crate not a crate.
Then why aren't you driving?
I already confessed to everything.
But I violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
Yeah, I know you know I know I violated departmental insurance.
Well, do we have to go to the store?
You know what?
