What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
What are you doing to me?
You're tearing into me right now.
Oh, my God!
Oh my God, his head is in his food.
What the hell is happening?!
I need medical attention.
A dog crate.
Holy crap!
Holy shit!
Man, that dog is fast. He's going to need a lot of surgery.
That's enough.
I understand. Dr. Wong, we're taking PET into cardiac arrest.
No problem Brad.
If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...
If I lay those eggs, you're gonna have to call me a helicopter.
Well, Morty, if you lay them at my cervix, you can call me an alien, if I lay them here, you'll die.
Shut up, Morty!
Shut it down! You're not gonna have any issue here, buddy.
You shut up!
