What's up Rick!
Hey, there's no need to freak out. You know fully well that Morty and I have a very specific dynamic going on here.
Oh, for fuck’s sake.
I’m not letting you let my sister die!
Oh! Oh! Oh, God!
What the hell is going on?!
The galactic government collapsed.
Shut it down!
I thought the Galactic Federation collapsed?
It was a goodie, Morty. You should be proud.
Yeah, Rick. I appreciated that.
Well, I mean, you tried to warn us, Morty
Well it turns out the truth is, Morty, you were right about the whole time.
But the government collapsed? And the government was dismantled?
We moved around so much it’d technically be the same day.
You realize that was the day the dinosaurs came calling Jerry Smith from Earth?
You didn’t tell us there were dinosaurs?
I told you there were lies!
Well if there were aliens in the sky, there would be dinosaurs!
There are no aliens in space, and there are no dinosaurs, and the only evidence that climate change was a clear signal that the dinosaurs were depleting.
There were no dinosaurs in the Cervine Institute, and they didn‘t alter the climate.
