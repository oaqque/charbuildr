What's up Rick!
Morty, twenty people in a room yelling!
Hey, listen, we got about twenty people yelling in a row, and we need to get schwifty.  Get schwiggly out of here!
Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell?
Rick, twenty different people yelling at you in a loud, loud, almost defeated, way. It's like we're not even trying to hide.
Oh, man.
I'm not proud to share this, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.
There's gonna still be one.
Are you kidding me?!?!
There is one.  One.  Come on, Morty.
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
You mean Noob?  Hey, listen! The name's real, and it's not like we could have just hid this whole time.
We had a little incident. You're our hero, Morty, and you're our Morty. You've handled this far better than we could've handled it.
You're our boy, Summer.
Yeah, Rick! I'm really sorry about that.
That's a three-pointer!
That was amazing, Morty!
You should be a lawyer.
If you feel threatened by that, call the cops.
What?
What the hell? What are you talking about?!
