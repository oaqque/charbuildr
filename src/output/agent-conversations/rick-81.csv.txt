What's up Rick!
Morty!
Whoa wh-what the hell hell hell?
You can run But you can't hide, bitch!
Hold on, Morty. I need your help tonight.
Hold your fire! Hold your fire. I'm Morty Covington.
I need your services, Morty!
I'll be in the garage.
Calling u mr. turds.
Hi, Frank.
Mm-hmm.
Whoopsie!
Oh, my God!
That's better.
You should call Bob Saget.
He's alive.
Not anymore.
Jerry, we're taking fire from an automated turret. You're not gonna have enough energy left for a full-fledged inter-galactic communication. We can't bring Jerry back.
But we can put him on a Blackhawk with a laser and call it a day. That'll really bring it home.
Yeah, Rick, I like that idea, Morty
I was thinking about setting up camp in a sewer tunnel, like, like in the 70's or something. But that's not the issue, Rick.
