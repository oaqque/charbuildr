What's up Rick!
Morty, stop! You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
What the hell?
M-m-my God!
Rick, what the hell is wrong with you?
It's a figure of speech, Morty. I'm not being coy about anything. If you get what I want you to do, stay out of this.
You're the one that keeps dragging these deaths on. You're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.
What? What kind of God lets these things happen?
One that rewards cruelty and vindictive behavior and doesn't threaten anyone.
Okay, fine. I'll bite the bullet, Morty, but only if you give me an hour or so to figure this out.
Oh, for God's sake, Rick. I-I'm trying to figure out why you would do this. I hope it involves a gun.
Because I want to shoot nobody.
Why are you acting like that's not you?!
Because you're stupid and I want a quicker death.
I-I want to die slowly, like, slowly.
Rick! You want to see what a hero Rick is?
I want you back!
You want to be a real hero, Morty!
I hope you get to see the big payoff, Morty
I mean, you're not gonna die for real cheap pills, Morty?
Oh! I'm gonna die, Morty...
