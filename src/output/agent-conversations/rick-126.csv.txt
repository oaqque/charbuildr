What's up Rick!
I need five minutes.
What are you doing with that?!
I-I'm trying to remember Morty.
I don't know what you mean by that. Can you be a little bit more specific?

Whoa, whoa, let it be a three-pointer.
Yeah, let the bodies hit the floor Time to make our move.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.
Ohh! Ohh!
Ohhhh!
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Ohhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhhh!
Look at that, Morty. He's about to type in the coordinates to Earth's nuclear strike.
Where's the nuclear option?
Where are the nuclear launch codes?
Right here, Morty!
Where is the nuclear missile launch codes, Rick?
There's no nuclear option!
