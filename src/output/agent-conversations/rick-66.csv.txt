What's up Rick!
What are you doing to me?!
What is love?
What's love? You little piece of shit!
Oh, come on. You know I can't.
Ohh! Oh! Ohh! Gross! Gross.
What the hell is wrong with you two!?
I know you're mad because you don't give Morty props for making fun of Rick. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts.
Morty, you're freaking me out.
Aw, man.
Look, I know you love me. I just wanted to let you know that, Morty, if you keep coming at me, I'm coming at you. You're scaring me.
Scaring you?
That's a three-pointer!
You're scarily close!
Scary Terry.
Close!
Close.
So, you two make quite a team.
Weird breed.
You two make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, I guess.
