What's up Rick!
Hey, hey, hey!
Morty, hold the phone, it's you guys!
Oh, man, I'm late to class because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.
What the hell?
What, I don't know. I mean, look, I know a lot about the topic, and it's hard to understand but when you're not sure what you want for lunch, you can make your own rules.
You're allowed to have an opinion, but you can't bring a knife to a gun fight.
This is a great adventure, Morty. But, uh, you're under arrest.
"For Godâ€™s sake, Nathan, why would you bring a gun to a knife fight?
Because I love you, Morty! And I would fight for Jerry Smith if I could!
I love you too, Jessica!
Holy crap! This is insane!
Jessica.
Jessica?
Uh, yeah, Jessica.
Is that Jessica or Beth?
Jessica from the first season of that show.
Oh man, Jessica?
Ohh! Oh, man.
Holy shit.
Jesus! Jessica. Beth.
