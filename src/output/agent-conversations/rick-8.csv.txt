What's up Rick!
Hey there, stranger. How you doing?
Ohh! Ohh!
Aaaaah! Oh! Ohhh!
Ooh! Oh, my God! He's in agony!
He's in pain, Jerry!
Oh, he sure is. Oh, he really is.
He sure is, sweetie.
Oh! Ohhhh!
Is that a pocketful of Ricks?
I'm a Rick! I'm more of a Billy Corgan.
Are you a Billy Creamery?
Are we not invited?
Come on, Morty. You know you want to be an even bigger ball of shit.
Big Morty is gonna need a bigger penis.
You know what, I'm gonna need that big penis, Morty? That's what Big Morty needs to be doing.
That's enough, Big Morty. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
All right, Ruffles, Ruffle, Ruffled up.
Whoa, whoa! Hey, Rufflet!
Who's this?
You're a golden example of what this breed is all about.
