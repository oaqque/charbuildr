What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
M-m-my partner. Morty.
Wh-what are you doing out of class?
Just hanging out and stuff.
You know what, Rick? I-I'm really looking at you right now. You know what I want you to do with all that cash. I want YOU to have it. I'm gonna give it to YOU, Morty. You're a real big help to me.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Summer.
Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page all the time.
Oh, no, Rick, I'm late to class again. I mean, it was nice to have you back, Morty, but I mean really bad news for you.
It's okay, Morty!
Whoa, whoa, what's wrong?
Look, I know I know you're passionate, but you're not as fast as the other kids, and you're also not as smart as a pickle, so I'll pass judgment on this one.
I know you know I was right about the matter, Morty
Yeah. I know. I was. I shouldn't have to make babies.
That's a poor decision, Rick.
No, you shouldn't do that, Morty you know that's not a good idea.
Good thing I should have gotten counseling, Morty...  I should get counseling.
Rick, Rick! Therapists, Therapist, Therapy, Therapist, Thermists, I mean people with those things are people with high-developed brains.
Don't worry about getting pregnant, Morty? Therap, Morty's not getting pregnant.
