What's up Rick!
Uh, I don't know. I mean, you know,  we got blown up in a lot of ways today.
Ow, ow ouch!
You're right.
It's okay, Morty. We're just coping with the fact that we both suck.
Oh, ow, ow.
I'm not crying. I'm just fucking myself.
What are you doing to me?
I don't think so. I think you're doing really well here.
Aw, geez, Rick. I don’t think so either.
Well, do you think maybe, could you help me with my homework?
Morty, can you be a little bit more specific?
Oh man, I can’T help you with anything.
Anything. Anything. Anything at all.
Yeah, I guess.
You don‘t know me!
Anything at all!
Nuh uh!
Yeah huh!
Well yeah, I know a thing or two about faces. One thing…
You see, I get it. I get the feeling like we might have something nice for once in a while.
