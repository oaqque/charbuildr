What's up Rick!
Morty, I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go.
What?
That's it, Morty. You're the man I want you to be.
M-m-my partner. Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
Oh, man.
I know. I know. It's really frustrating.
That means we're F'd in the A.
Yeah, well, I know that's a three-pointer. But you know, I mean, you know-you're not gonna get away with this one, you knobs.
You're right, Rick, we're screwed.
All right, well I'll-let you be the judge, Morty
I'll judge you later, Morty, for now, I'll just be calling you Rick.
Okay, fine. I'm calling you that.
Alright, fine, fine I'll call you that, Rick. You'll always be my Rick. And I'll always remember that. That's because you're always so supportive of me. And that's because I love you, Morty! And that is how I will die.
Ooh! Oh, my God! Oh! Ohh! Ohhhh! Ohhhhh! Oh.
Rick!
Oh! Ohhh! Oh man, that is scary.
Come on, Morty?
You better stop with that. You better stop pretending you're scared or something.
The trick to death is to death isn't real!
It's real! You better hit is real! He's dead.
