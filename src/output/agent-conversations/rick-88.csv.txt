What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
Hey, Morty!
Whoa!
Come on!
Yeah, I know. I know how to react to certain people. I've done it. I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention.
That deer needs about four hours of sleep.
I need about tree fiddy.
Look, I'm not touching this. You tell me.
Mm-hmm.
You should know that deer have the power of two human eyes and a human's heart and a brain.
Yeah?
That's it!
I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
Oh, for crying outâ€”he's got more control here than I anticipated.
What the hell?
Oh God, what did you guys just do?
We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and we were worried you might attack wildlife, and if you keep acting crazy we could put you inside your crate because it's got a heart in it! And you know what, I mean, you're not gonna let me get my pride wrapped up in your shame.
The fact is, you know I was trying to kill you!
You're a fucking moron!
