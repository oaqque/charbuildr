What's up Rick!
Uh-oh.
Uh, here we go!
What the hell is wrong with you two!?
I sense your suspicion is fading.
Yeah, I sense your insecurity. I sense yours is fading as well.
Oh, well, maybe I sensed something was weird when you stopped talking about race. Maybe I sensed your insecurity was fading. Oh, well. I suppose that's possible.
You two make quite a team.
We all do.
Yes?
We do. That's what heroes do. Let's be rational about this.
But I thought we were married!
We aren't married anymore, Alan.
Alan, you fucking moron!
You're tearing me apart!
Yeah.
Your mom is a hero.
Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone?
Yeah I bet she would have been more supportive of you if you hadn't kill your wife!
That's a lot of work, Jerry.
I'm a genius. You're a musician, too. You should be a musician.
