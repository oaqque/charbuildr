What's up Rick!
Morty, Morty, what are you doing out of class?
Ugh, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
It's not your fault we froze time on a humid day!
Yeah, it's not my fault we hit 70 C.
Well, I mean, you know, technically the second law of Thermodynamics is that you don't alter the polarity of a system until it's time to stop working.
Hey, I know you're a little late to the party, but you've been pretty active this whole time. So raise your hand if you feel like you've sustained a significant amount of damage.
What the fuck? I mean you're freaking me out!
Whoa, whoa! Look at that. He's smirking.
Oh, he sure does. He sure does, he really loves me.
You're freaking cute!
You said the same thing!
Oh my God! Oh my God, my head.
Ahh! Oh, my God. He said something!
Aww! Oh! Ohhhhh! Ohh!
What is wrong?
You think I'm attractive?
Look at that lady getting dressed for Halloween!
That's not even Halloween! That's not Halloween! Come on, man!
Don't high-roaded!
Come on, Morty! Come, Morty.
