What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
Mooorty, Morty!
Boo!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooooa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
Is it your house?
Where are you?
On my work bench, Morty.
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
I'm gonna pee on your special moneys!
Oh, man.
You're really going to flip your lid over this one.
Yeah, it's a bit. But you're still gonna need a little help, Morty, otherwise, you're goners.
All right, Ruffles.
Well, Ruffled up Morty, give me that.
Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick!  Oh, my God, that’s enough!
Ready?
Ready!
Yes!
You better believe I‘m standing right here with you!
