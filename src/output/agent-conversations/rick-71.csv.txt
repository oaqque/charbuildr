What's up Rick!
Morty, come on!
I'm a full season behind.
What?
Rick, you're behind. We just got him back!
Hey, look, we're up against a wall this time, Morty.
Hey! Look! It's our boy Rick Sanchez!
We're taking fire from an automated turret!
Take cover, Morty!
It's a trap!
Come on, Morty, you got to get the hell out of here!
What the hell?
Come get this delicious brine. Come on, motherfuckers!!
Come to the bathroom!
Oh, my God.
Oh! Oh, my GOOOOODDDD!!!
Ohhhh!
That's the vibe I'm giving.
Come check it out, Rick. It's working.
Can you hear me, Rick?
It won't let me out.
