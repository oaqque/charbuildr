What's up Rick!
I'm a pickle!
Pickle Riiick!
You're a pickles!
Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell is wrong with you two!?
We moved around so much it's hard to remember. You two make quite a team.
Yeah, but you guys don't exactly roll with the dinosaurs.
I don't know what to say. They came to the same conclusion that Morty was a terrorist, and the only way to kill them was through logic. Simple as that.
Well, you know, the reason I killed them was to stop them. Simple!
Rick, you're a good kid, but these arms are getting taut.
Morty, we're worried about your father. You should be worried about his work.
He's a good boy. But you're not as fast as a pickled leprech.
Whoa, whoa, hey.
You can run but you can't hide, bitch!
Who cares how fast you run?
Who wants to see my Pog collection?
Oh, damn.
Ohh! Oh, damn! Ohh!
Oh! Oh! Oh.
Ooh! Ohhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhhh! Oh...
