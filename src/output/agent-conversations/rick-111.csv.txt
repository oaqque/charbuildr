What's up Rick!
Morty!
The-m-m.
Rick?
M-m!
Rick!
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
Hey, it's Rick. Listen, I know you're not as fast as the other kids, but you're still pretty fast. And that's not a big deal, right? I mean, look at that. You're wearing a Vindicator jacket.
Yeah, well, I mean I was thinking about it.
It's Summer, not the Series 9000, man.
You know what I'm talking about, Rick? This is the Series 6 equivalent of Scary Terry.
Wow. I wonder what the hell are they doing with that guy's brain.
He's dead.
Jesus Christ, Rick, that's dark.
What?
Jesus. He's not joking, this is serious.
Oh, Jesus.
Holy crap. Okay, calm down, Morty. You don't know what we're doing here!
We're taking fire from an automated turret!
Put it on!
Ohh! Ohh!
