What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
What are you talking about?!
The election’s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
Jessica.
Morty!
You made me miss Rick’
You make fun of me all the time, and now you got me singing a sad, sad, old, wounded animal!
Oh, man, oh, man.
Oh man. Oh, man!
Holy crap.
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
You're acting crazy, or something.
You don’t know me!
Don’T threaten her!
Look, I’m just saying, if she wants to leave I‘m not gonna threaten her.
Look at her! Look at her. Look at how fickle this family is!
I’ve seen enough of this to know that when our son shows up in a couple of crucial situations, we can’d like, you know, end up getting him to the hospital and having him wrapped up in bubble wrap for the night and dropping it to the floor and dropping to the carpet!
The day the shit hits is all over her! All right, Morty, you made it real loud and loud!
That’ll take a lot of damage!
It’re all over.
