What's up Rick!
Morty, the Vindicators are back!
Huh?
Rick, we were robbed.
Mm-hmm.
Ah, well, no problem Brad.
Uh, I mean, you know, technically the Vinners aren't real.
Buckle up, bitch!
Bitch!
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, whoa! Whoooooooa!
You guys doin’ a little chemistry homework with Morty and Beth?
We try to shelter you from certain realities, Morty. Like in Rick’s case he's too stupid to get his portal gun and we need him to help us get to his portal home.
Oh, God!
Rick!
Yeah, you see, I-I'm really bad at this. I know it's embarrassing to admit, but I know a lot of people fall for it. I mean look at how much money I've made. I've been lied to my family, Morty, I know the reason why. I lied to you to get out of coming here. I did it so I could put my faith in you, Morty
Oh.
It’ll be fine. Just don’t let her know that, Morty!
That’d be a good idea, Rick.
You should tell her that. That’m—that—that is a terrible idea.
That is absolutely horrible, Rick! You should know that is a serious threat.
