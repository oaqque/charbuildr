What's up Rick!
Hey there, stranger. How you doing?
Ohh my God! Oh! Ohh my GOOOOODDDD!!!
Ohhh my GOOODDDDDD!
I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.
Oh, my God.
Our home world is just a giant turd.  Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!
Oh!
Come on, Morty! Come on!
That's enough. We're taking charge of this situation, don't even trip.
We're not here for graduation, buddy.
I hope you're putting something pretty goddamn important in there.
That is a three-pointer!
"I hope they see me as their Morty."
I bet they do.
Sweetie, you really are the Brad.
Hey, honey, I bet they really like you.
You're hot.
Don't let them get you, okay? You're a good kid.
Shut up, Morty, you fucking moron!
You shut up!
