What's up Rick!
What's the matter with you Morty?
What the hell hell hell?
You're alive?!
What? What the hell? What happened?
I sense that your suspicion is setting us up for a very unfortunate future.
Oh, for crying outâ€”he's not bluffing!
He's not the only one.
He can travel through dreams. He can travel even theoretical quadrants through dreams!
Ohhhh, shit.
We're back!
We were almost asleep the whole time?!
Ohhhhh!
Look, I know you're young, but you're still learning about quantum mechanical keyboards. You've been sleeping on this desk for a long time, and you know... you're not gonna wake up every single night.
It's okay, Summer, I understand your feelings. I mean, they're both equally frustrating to me.
Yeah, I get it. But you're both frustrating to look at.
But you're also kind of a nuisance to me, so let's just get through this as quickly as possible.
I feel like I have to type in the coordinates to our home world, and I need you to do it so we can go take a look at the stars.
No way.
Look at this, Jerry. It's perfect. It'll be perfect. Right now, Morty, let's go.
Now, we're gonna go to the Ascension.
