What's up Rick!
Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Rick. It's not a very popular opinion.
Rick, what are you doing to me?
M-m-my partner. I'm trying to kill myself.
Marry me.
A-actually, Morty.
Whoa, whoa! Whoooooooa! Whoooa.
You're looking feral. I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.  It's hard to explain.
Yeah, I know.  That's a three-pointer!
It's a figure of speech, Morty, Morty! You're the man of the house!
Oh, man.
Oh man. Oh, man, oh, man!
You know what? I gotta laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife.
It was a good decision, Rick! I almost peed in class instead of crying.
I'm glad you're okay, Morty
Ohh! Oh, geez, gawd, gah! Oh! Ohh! Okay, Rick, I'm okay.
What?
Oh! What's wrong?
Uh, what's wrong?!
Oh.
Uh oh, gosh. Oh!
