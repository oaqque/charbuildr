What's up Rick!
Uh, yeah, I think we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty. It's time to make our move.
Make it bounce.
No, you didn't.
Oh, man.
What the hell is wrong with you people?! You're always picking on me and now you're trying to make me feel bad.
You're the worst.
Aw, man! Oh, man, man...
I know. I know. It makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training.
It's okay, Morty, I know you were acting crazy. I mean, it's okay to laugh at myself.
Well, I mean he kind of had to in order to get out of school.
I was also part of the school's test line of defense against the evil Grampa family.
Morty, I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is I just kept crawling, and it kept working.
Alright, Morty! We're goners now!
Yeah, Morty...
Y-You know what? I-I'm really bad at this.
Good thing I saw that note.
If you keep coming at me, I'll talk to you later.
Come on, Morty?
Yeah. You know what, Morty is this stuff that you keep slipping into your subconscious? You know, that's what's important.
Yeah... I know what's crucial to keep you coming at you.
