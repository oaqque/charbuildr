What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
Hey, I can't help if I can barely see.
Look, I know you're young, but you're still not as fast as the other kids, which is a big deal for you.
Who cares how big the pickle is? Everyone has to eat a pickle.
You don't have to be pickle to understand this, Morty. If you want to understand why, just go on the pickles.
What the fuck?
Because you touch yourself and you die.
And then you eat a literal pickle!
And you're gonna die. And you're also gonna die! And you know, Summer, because I'm fucking pickle and you're fucking scary!
You're gonna love this, Rick!  And I'm gonna love you, Morty! And I hope you're proud of yourself!
Pickle Riiick!
Hey there, Jessica.
Jessica.
Mm-m-my partner is Dr. Wong.
Rick, Morty, Jessica, Jessica's your math is off.
Hey!
Jessica, Jessica?
Jessica?
Mmm.
