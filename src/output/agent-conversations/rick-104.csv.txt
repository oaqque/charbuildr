What's up Rick!
Uh, what's up Morty?
What's good Morty? What's up?
Oh, man.
Whoa, whoa, hey, who's this?
Aaaah!
Who's this now?
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
Yeah, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.
He wants that to stop.
What?
Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.
Oh God, what did you guys do?
We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.
I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
I didn't!
Don't worry about Jerry, Summer. He's new. He doesn't understand how it works.
Holy shit! He just kept saying "I told ya so."
I hope I told you so!
That's enough!
"That's it, Rick! That's enough. We're goners for days!
