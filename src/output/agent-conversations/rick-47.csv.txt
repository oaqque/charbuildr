What's up Rick!
Morty!
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
What the hell is Nooby?
I am Phoenixperson.
Million Ants, ladies and gentleman!
Rick, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
That's it, Rick! I'm making my move.
Noob-noob!
Oh, you know what? I'm really going for the mega ant colony at Area 51.
Is that where you're going?
That was the surprise, Morty.
Come on, Morty! The ants are coming in.
Ohh!
Ow, ouch!
The ant colony.
Rick? Is that you?
The Vindicators? Are you far away, or are you inside something?
Just keep shooting, Morty, you don’t know who I am talking about!
