What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
What are you doing to me?
Ugh!
Don't think about it!
The trick to good taste is keeping my lip level with the liquid.
What the hell are you talking about?!
You're talking about my lip- fluid. I'm talking about liquid. You're talking liquid right now.
Oh, man. I don't know if I can.
You don't have to say anything. You know fully well that Jerry's not gonna happen.
Jerry, you're a good kid. You've got a bright future ahead of you, and that's something that can be said about a lot of people. But you're not gonna regret it.
Yeah, thanks, Rick. I appreciate it. I've been pretty close to death, so now that I know not to touch it, but, uh, I'm gonna try to keep my mouth shut.
That's enough, Rick! You know what I'm talkin' about, Morty. I mean, you know, "bitch."
