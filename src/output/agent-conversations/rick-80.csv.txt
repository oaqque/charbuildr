What's up Rick!
Morty, stay out of this. You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
You're right. We can't kill a pickle!
Oh, I'm sorry. I misjudged you. I thought you were dead. You okay?
Pickle Riiick!
What the hell?
You were right. All aboard!
Aah!
I'm a full season behind.
Aaaaaaah!
Rick, who's this now?
I believe he is.
He's talking about Game Of Thrones.
Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Rick, I remember the conversation. I remember our little league game. The Citadel put up a fight. The Vindicators were defeated by a student with a giant scar on his cheek. The student was decapitated by a giant head in a costume.
That's a three-pointer!
Ey, ey, ey.
Ey!
Whoa!
Hey, ey!
Look at that. He recognizes the Vindicator.
You two make quite a team.
