What's up Rick!
Whoa wh-what are you doing?
Just hanging out and stuff.
What are you doin'?
Trade secret, bro. G-Goodbye.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick!
You better run, Morty!
Rick, you better not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
It's a trap!
Come on, Morty. We got to get the hell out of here!
What?!
It was all part of his plan!
Jerry, we were gonna take him out anyway!
If you break your weak ass dawg, it's yours!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate about his brand of knives, and you're probably a terrorist. I hope I can forgive you.
No! Bad words, bad words, oh, oh!
Morty!
Okay, I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer.
Shut off the motor, Rick! You're scaring me.
