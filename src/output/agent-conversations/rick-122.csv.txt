What's up Rick!
What are you doing to me?!
What's my plan, Morty? I'm trying to kill you!
Oh, man.
Oh man. I'm sorry. I know how it feels to root for you guys. But you guys just took us all the way to the Superdicks, Morty. You're gonna be fine!
All right, Ruffles. Let's make this three for three.
Well, since we're fighting in a sewer tunnel here, I'm gonna say... we both have to be pretty certain we're not being turds.
That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick! You're turding me right now!
You're tuffling my enamel, Morty!
That doesn't sound like Rick work.
Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! Drop it, Rick.
It's a plane! We have control over this man! We can take him off if we need him! We got to get him off of this guy!
He's not on board, Jerry. He's a terrorist! We captured him and he's gonna blow our brains out! We'll bring him to justice. We're going to his country and 9/11 is his number!
Jerry, 9/20, huh?
I don't think you know what's going on.
If you do, I get a buzzcut, Morty, and you get a haircut, Morty
Ohh!
Aah!
It was a bit.
Aaah!
Okay, that's enough, Morty..
