What's up Rick!
Morty, Morty, stop! You're not bluffing!
Buckle up, bitch!
What the fuck?
Whoa, whoa, hold the phone, hold on a second, Morty. You know what I'm talking about here? This is the President.
Hey, hold your fire!
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were dead.
Wait, what?
Well, since you're responding to me, I assume you're either stupid, or a really nice guy.
Who cares? We got  all the time in the shit and you still don’t give it right back?
Okay, well, let’s give it back to Rick for good behavior.
Mm-hmm.
Well this is a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
Ohh!
You can't, Jerry!
I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.
Ooh! Ohh! Oh! Oh, geez! Ohhhhh!
Oooooh!
Ahhh, gawg!
Holy crap!
No way.
