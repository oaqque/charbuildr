What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
Boo!
Whoooooo!
What the hell is happening?!
Our defense is doing really well. It’s the middle of the night.
Our offense is doing pretty well too.
What is happening Grampa?
We are losing to a top 3 defense in a division with one of the worst O lines in the league.
We have to win?
Let’ll see if we can’t.
I say we show them we’re still in it and we can compete in the A’tion
We’ve been saying that for a long time now. But what do you think we can do?
Our O line is garbage and our special look is our O line.
If we can stop giving Smith Smith Smith rest he can just come out and play
Our o line is doing just fine.
Smith, stop trying to injure Smith!
Smith?
Smith is doing fine. You just keep him out of this game!
You know what?
