What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a portal to another dimension. We're gonna go into another dimension, Morty. You're gonna need a lot of help here.
What?!
Where are you going?
I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That is what heroes do.
Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? Come on, give me that.
Whoa!
Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?
Just a bunch of ordinary bugs hanging out. You don't really need to worry about Rick, Morty, unless you know the full details of what's in the syringe.
That's a three-pointer!
And you know what, I'm really bad at this.
Yeah, it's not like I could have made a whole new syringe for a friend of mine.
Okay, Morty...
You know what? Okay.
Alright, good.
You're right. This is the last straw, Morty
For all we know, Rick's gonna be the last survivor of that crystal.
For everybody.
And for everybody.  And for everybody else.
Rick, who's gonna take his place? Probably not gonna be Rick.
