What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here!
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Hold on a second, Morty! The storm is stopping!
Hey, who's this?
You know, that's right, Morty, we're in a storm!
No way.
Yeah, way.  Yeah, way, way!
Yeah way. No way. You win this.
No, way you did this, Rick. You're a good kid, Morty
Yeah. You really are. You've been a huge help to me. Thank you, Rick!  You really do everything for me.
You're a real big help to us, Morty...
Thanks, Rick, I appreciate it.
Don't worry about Rick, Morty he's gonna be fine. Just stay away from the Vindicators. They know too much about this stuff. They're the worst.
Good job, Rick... they know a lot about this, and they know not to mess with it. Good job, Morty they know we're not gonna need you anymore.
Oh, for God's sake, that is a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
All right, all right, well done. Well done.
Ah, geez, Rick I'm really getting high-g', real serious now.
Look, I'm gonna go get a haircut.
Now, take these scissors, cut them up your sleeves and fold them over your hands and yank me a little bit of my dumb ass!
