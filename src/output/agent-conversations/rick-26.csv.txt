What's up Rick!
Morty, stay out of this. You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
Oh, come on, Rick. We got to get out of here. You know fully well that Morty wishes never come true.
I wish this was about sex.
Yeah, well, you know, that's pretty obvious from the haircuts.
You wish this wasn't about sex, Morty.
Well, maybe I wish that was the case, but I doubt it.
That's dark, Morty, and probably a good reason why you shouldn't date a Rickless girl.
Because, you're probably a horrible influence on the child's life and possibly the family's entire thought process.
Oh God, what did you guys do?
We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.
Jerry, you've been a monster. I'm so sorry.
Mm sorry about what's happening here, but it's probably best for myself to just get over there and deal with it. You've been doing so much with portals and stuff for so long, you don't deserve this!
It's okay, Morty! We're taking it real serious, and it's important to get over here. If you ever need anything, just say goodbye!
Hey, Morty...
You're growing up fast. You have a really nice titties.
Ugh, you really dropped the ball, Morty
You know what?
That was a huge misunderstanding, Morty?
I'm so fucking serious, it was a bit of a bit.
It was a misunderstanding, it, Morty's okay.
