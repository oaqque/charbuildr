What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
What are you doing to me?
Say it with me!
Ooohhhh!
Ohhh!
Aaaaah!
That's the vibe I'm giving.
Ohhhhhh!
Come on, come on.
Come get this delicious brine.
Mm-hmm.
I need that "Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty.
What the hell is that?
It's a memory. I've had enough, Rick. Don't do this.
It was a bit. It's all over, Rick! All of a sudden, a bunch of Ricks came and killed us.
A bunch of them, too.
All right, all right.
Yeah, I'm not proud of this, but at least I didn't kill five innocent Mortys.
Rick, whoever did this is a horrible influence on our children.
You're a horrible parent, Morty!
