What's up Rick!
Morty, I'm gonna need your help tonight.
M-m-my man.
SLI-I-It's okay, Morty. You're okay.
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're right!
He's right. We're back to square one!
I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. Your job is to be a helicopter surgeon, Morty, and you're a certified horse surgeon.
Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?
You want to see what a horse surgeon is? I'll do it for you.
I'm a horse plumber, not a helicopter plumber.
And what are you, a horse doctor?
I don't do horses.
Tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
Then you can go home.
What?
The second law of thermodynamics. Thermokumber is the combination of all the parts of a horse's brain that's kept alive for 72 hours.
But...but I thought you drank.
It's not a horse heart, it's a heart!
Well, I don't know what to say, Morty! It's a horse or a heart, or a grape or something.
That's a myth.
