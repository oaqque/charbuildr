What's up Rick!
What's the matter with you Morty?
You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty. You should know that by now.
What?
What the hell are you doing, Morty? I-I'm just doing my best.
Look, I know you're passionate about this, but I can promise you that if you keep shooting, we'll be able to win.
If we keep shooting we're gonna have to shoot nobody.
I-I don't know what to say.
You guys are both pretty solid. I can't really pick one over the other.
Yeah, I think you're both pretty bright. I mean, you both have a lot to work on. But I think we can be a tag team in a world populated by intelligent lifeforms.
But I think your tag team is pretty weak.
Oh, for crying out—out—out!
You two make quite a team.
We all do.
This is why I will leave you with your testicles.
That's a three-pointer!
That is a threepointer! You two make very different people.
Not so fast, Morty!
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! Ohh! Ohhhhh! Ohhhh!
The-he's coming for you!
All right, all right.
