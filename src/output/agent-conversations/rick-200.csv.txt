What's up Rick!
Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late.
M-m-my partner. Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
You know what I named these? My little Morties.
Oh, my God!
Ohhhh, my GOOOOODDDD!!!
Ohhhhhh!
Aaaaah!
I'm not crying, I'm just saying, these aren't the only two possibilities that exist.
Ahhhhhh
Ohhh, man.
I know. I know. It's really weird. I mean, I get the feeling this family is coping with fear in some way.
Yeah, but, you know, we don't exactly make eye contact.
That's a three-pointer!
Yeah.
Guys, we missed you so much. You know what, it's worth the risk. We all do it for our own good.
Eh, too bad.
Too bad. Too bad. All right, everybody in the universe is dead.
Not so fast, Morty. Too soon, though. Too late. Too real.
Hey, I can travel time. Can travel time, Morty!
Too soon. Too fast. Too mainstream.
