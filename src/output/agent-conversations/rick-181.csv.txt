What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a giant hole in the floor with a portal gun and a bunch of lava in it. I mean, it's not like you could just walk out of here and grab a shovel.
Where's the giant hole?
Right here, Morty.  Come on. We got to get the hell out of this goddamn building.
What?!
Oh, God, what did you guys just do?
We exterminated a planet!
Come on, Morty! We got got to go.
Holy crap! We have to go, Morty
What happened?
They tried to kill us.
I sense that you're busy. Perhaps tomorrow we can arrange a letter to the President, where he will hand me my sixth season of Scraps.
You realize that was fake?
Fifth season is his sixth season.
Fifteen seasons is not his first season. He's unpredictable and eccentric. He also has a tendency to misdirect.
Rick, why are you acting like that's not you?!
You know, I mean-I-I know you're probably a little drunk, but I-I just wanted to let you know that, Morty, that was the last straw that will ever be in your rectum.
Ohh...
Fifty-fourteen seasons.
How many seasons is that?
