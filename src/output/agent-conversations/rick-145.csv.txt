What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
Boo!
Whoa! Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
What the hell is Nooby?
It's a device, Morty. It's supposed to detect when our son, Morty has dropped the ball. It also alerts the government that certain drugstore f'd in the school.
What?
Yeah, you can get him back. I mean, come on, it's not like he's a kid.
Who cares, Morty? Come on, Morty! We got to get out of here!
I sense that you're busy.
Mm-hmm.
That's enough, Rick.
I-I-Is that it, Rick? I'm almost finished.
Oh, my God, what did you guys just do?
We violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
Holy crap!
That was fantastic, Morty, Morty
I know you know I appreciated it, Morty but you're probably not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.
You know what? You're right!
Yeah! I'm not proud of what we did, Morty But if I had done it, I coulda done it quicker.
