What's up Rick!
What's the matter with you Morty?
You're always picking on me. You're so petty.
Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That's so awesome.
It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. You do the same thing, and we're both adults that want what's best for our son.
Then why aren't you helping him, Jerry?
Because he's not me. He's my partner. And I don't really care about anyone's feelings.
You don't have to be mean, sweetie.
Aw, fuck.
Look, I know you're frustrating me, but it's better than making my problems other people's problems.
Okay, fine. I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, okay.
I understand your feelings. I understand your anger. But, uh, I don’t think it’s necessary to keep talking about this. You know, if I were to talk about it, I think you might get sick of your life.
Shut up, Jerry. You’re an animal.
If I were you, I wouldn’d eat more vegetables.
Jerry, stop saying that! Stop saying that. You are making my pee problem.
Listen!
You’ve obviously never put enough pressure on yourself to get that pickle to make it work.
All right, all right, Morty. All right, take these seeds are gonna be good for my precious pheromone.
That’m…
You know what a pheros are for ants?
