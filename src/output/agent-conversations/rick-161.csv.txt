What's up Rick!
Morty, I need your help tonight.
M-m-my partner and I are going to look into it. I think it might be a good idea to look at it.
Yeah, that's a three-pointer!
I mean, you know, technically the second law of Thermodynamics is that you can't alter anything.

Actually, you can alter any part of anything you want about anything you don't like about anything about your life.
You can alter the chemical release in your brain, which will lead you to a state of mind that makes no sense at all, which is why you can only enter certain theoretical situations.
I can alter a chemical release, which can't be considered a knock-off of another's mind.

Oh, man, Rick, I'm really getting high-roaded today.
All right, calm down, Morty. This is a lot like a drunk, high-road version of Drunk Rick. Drunk Rick, this is insane.
Holy crap. This isn't even our time. We're living it up here!
We're living in a rented car, Morty! We're in a bubble! We rented a bubble.
We are in a real bubble!
Woahh!
No way, this isn't real!
Oh. This timeline, Morty, Morty?
What?
This timeline?
