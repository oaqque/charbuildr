What's up Rick!
What's good Morty?
Good morning, sweetie. How are you doing?
Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, my GOOOOODDDD!!!
What the hell is happening?!
I sense that you're about to type in the coordinates to Earth's supernova.
Ohhhh my GOOODDDDDD!
Congrats, you did it!
We did it... we did it.
It's okay, Morty. We're taking him back.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
He's alive!
He was a terrorist, man! He was a rogue Rick -- a terrorist! We put him in a dog crate because he could be put in a crate and nobody would take him back!
Then we'll put him on a leash and call him Snuffles.
Snuffles?
Snuzzles? Is that a thing?
I don't know, Morty, I don't even know what that is.
What is that thing? What is that?!
It means "I love lasagna".
It also means "love" in germanic language, Morty!
