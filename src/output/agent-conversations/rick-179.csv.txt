What's up Rick!
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
Rick, can we fact-check this?
It's not my house. It's Grandpa's.
Mm-hmm.
I don't know what to say. I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Eventually I got it.
And then I peed on the carpet, and now you know why.
Because I used to wear blue pants.
Why am I still wearing these?
They say they're for the greater good.  That means they came first.
Je-Jesus!
Holy crap. Okay, good. These aren't the parts I was expecting. These parts are triggering me.
These aren't your parts, Morty! These parts, from now on, will be used to analyze and react to all your favorite sports! You're a genius, Morty, and you know how to react to everything! Listen to me! Listen! Listen, I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't understand how to play the trumpet! I'm a genius! Listen at me!
Listen! Listen I-I told you not to analyze it, Morty
What?!
Listen, Morty it's okay to analyze things. Listen at all. Listen! You have to analyze them. Listen to us! Listen carefully! Listen closely! Listen for the complexities of the cases. Eventually, the ratio of thickness of these things will determine if the ratio is perfect, Morty's gonna end up as one of the many pieces of paper you'll never get it's never getting off.
Oh, Rick! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. I'm gonna analyze this. I need to analyze this, okay!
You're gonna analyze it's gonna analyze.
Okay, look at the ratio. I'll analyze it. You're gonna get it. Morty. I see that one of these.
Alright, look inside of these, Morty get a lot of these guys getting it.  I'm in the ratio, Morty Morty.
Yeah, Morty and the ratio for a lot. I've got it's it's a lot more of these inside of them inside of those things inside of the ratio?
