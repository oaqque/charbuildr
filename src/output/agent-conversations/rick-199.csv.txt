What's up Rick!
Morty!
Who's this?
A sentient ghost train.
"Snuffles" is the name of the breed.
Huh, I didn't know there were still feral cats.
Mulan, take off your collars!
Scraps!
Oh, man, Rick, I can't believe we hit that guy with a car without shattering into two solidities.
That's enough!
You're talking about "Mulaney" Beth.
You don't know me!
Hey, it's okay, you're alive!
Yeah, it was.
And so is that dog.
I sense that you're stress eating.
Aw, man.
Damn. Oh, man...
Look, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you know I really appreciated the time you put my faith in this. You know, if we could have just stuck with Rick for a little bit longer he might have figured it out.
Well, he's dead.
Whoa, whoa, now, you know, I appreciate the effort you put into this. But, you don't have to rub it in.
