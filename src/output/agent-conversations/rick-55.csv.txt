What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick? W-where are you?
On my work bench, Morty.
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
Nope.
You're just a phantom train conductor, Morty! You don't even know me!
Oh, it takes brains to train, Morty, to train and you can't even see the train guy coming.
What? Incept me? You're a rogue Rick! You're the worst!
He's a rogue train conductor! He hides in plain clothes and hides in his art.
He hides in a dry cleaning bag under Mr. Benson's desk.
I'm not a hack, Morty -- I'm a full season behind.
Rick, you're acting crazy. You're acting like a full-fledged Rick -- like, "I told ya so."
Yeah, well, I-I-I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
I-It's okay, Morty
I know. I know. It's not your job to take sides or pass judgment. You-you're a good kid, Morty but you're really proving yourself.
Good job, Rick.
Mm-m-my job is to take side and pass judgment on the interdimensional border.
Ohhuh...
Oh.
The point is that you're being too stupid to understand.
