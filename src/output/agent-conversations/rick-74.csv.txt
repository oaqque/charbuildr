What's up Rick!
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
Rick?
M-m-my partner. Morty, I'm sorry.
Whoa, whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
Ohh! Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
Is it your house?
Where are you?
On my work bench, Morty
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
Uuuh.
Oh, my God!
What?
What the hell is happening?!
We have to go outside.
What is happening here?
The force is stopping.
Jerry, stop!
Whoooooooa!
WHAT?!
Ohhhhhh!
