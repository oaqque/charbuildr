What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
I told ya not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
Hey, it's fine. He's just a phantom train conductor. You don't really have to worry about him.
That's it, Rick! I'm taking the wheel!
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Who's got it better, Morty?
Who's got the shit on his face?
What the hell is that, Frank?
It's a device, Morty! It's a chemical that makes your brain secrete what's in your food. If you put it in your ear, you'll die.
What's the chemical thing?
Frank's got a chemical thing going on him that he's trying to use to kill us! It might be something we could put in our food, Morty.
Ugh, Frank.
It'll do, Frank!
Ugghh!
It won't do, Morty, it won't!
Don't worry about Frank. He'll be fine.
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry. I know you're worried about me. I'm a little worried about you.
Whoopsie! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh.
No, Frank is dying.
Yeah, Frank's worried about us.
