What's up Rick!
Morty, you're alive!
Uh, w-w-what are you doing to me?
Uh-huh.
I know. I know.  I-I know how to use Google Maps.  That's why I'm here.
What are you talking about?!
You're talking about my father, Morty! He -- he -- he murdered me!
He got wrapped up in an experiment. He turned himself into a pickle. He's a scientist. He created a pickles for the licks.
He turned himself back into a human.
Well, do you know what kind of science is that?
I don't think it's science. I think it involves a lot of chemical that makes you a pickled.
Alan, the chemical that lets you fall in love with a Rick.
Mulan, you've been doing it wrong for a long time. You're a picky little Morty. You should know that by now, you can no longer just fall in loving with a Morty.
You know,  that's not a flattering answer.
All right, Morty, time to go on, Morty.  Let's go.
Oh, geez.
Look, Rick. I mean, that's a lot to drop on a pickleg.
Hey, Jessica.
Come on, Jessica!
Come, Jessica, Jessica?
Ohhhhhh!
