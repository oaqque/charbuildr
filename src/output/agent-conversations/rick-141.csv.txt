What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
What are you doing to me?!
What is the matter with you Morty?
What's the matter, Morty? You're always picking on me. You're a thorn in my prickly prickly tooth!
You're a nuisance, Morty!
Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell?
It's a figure of speech, Morty. You don't have to use your real name, buddy. Just use your own.
Yeah, Rick, I know you're not as fast as the other kids, but you're still pretty fast. And that's not even my original Summer.
Well, do you know what I want you to do with that?!
Let's just get this over with, okay? You know, I-I don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
Oh, for crying outâ€”he's right.
All right, well, have fun with that.
I'll do it later, Morty, for later.
You better stop with that attitude.
Rick, stop with your stupid science. It's not worth it.
It'll melt if it gets in your eyes, Morty
That's not funny, Morty... that's a myth.
Okay, Morty I'll stop with my science. You heard of it, it, and you're a serious Rick now that's what we need to do.
Now, Morty we're gonna go get out there and we're gonn't just go get our family, Morty to the Ascension.
