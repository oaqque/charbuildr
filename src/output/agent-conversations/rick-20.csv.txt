What's up Rick!
Hey there, stranger. What are you doing out of class?
Oh, my God. He's in prison.
What? In prison?
Noooooo!
Ooooooaaahhh!
Ohhhhhh!
Aaaaah!
Rick, if we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
Ohhhh, I'm sorry. I mean, it's our world, and I know it's not like you're gonna have to do that. I'm just saying, sometimes, the dogs like to be â€œreemporarily" and sometimes, you gotta put them on a timer so when the dogs wear them out, you can set them on an even smaller timer.
Ah, shit.
You know what? Okay.
Yeah, you're right. I'll just do it myself.
I mean, you know, I mean I could've just used a time out of my life to save a life.
It's okay, Rick. You know what I mean.
That's not funny, Rick! That's not even my original Summer!
I'm so sorry.
We were robbed.
Ooh! Oh, geez, my parents, I feel so bad.
Rick!
What the hell?
