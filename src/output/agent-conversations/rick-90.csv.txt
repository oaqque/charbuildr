What's up Rick!
I'm Morty.
Morty!
Rick?
Are you far away, or are you inside something?
Mmm.
W-where are you?
On my work bench, Morty. Here's five minutes of my time.
What are you talking about?
Five minutes.
Oh, shit.
Look, I know you're young, but can you just come with me?
Hey, it's cool. You know what I named these? My little Morties.
That's a three-pointer!
Oh my God!
Holy crap!
Wow, that's better.
Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad.
"Oh, my God."
Jesus Christ! He's trying to tell us something.
Jesus! He wants our kids to have a normal life! We have to go to God! We're so screwed!
