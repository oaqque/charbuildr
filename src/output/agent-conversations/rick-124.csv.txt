What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick!
Come on, Morty. Come on!
What the FUCK?!
What are you doing, Rick?
Go to the bathroom.
Holy crap!
Hey, there, Jessica. What are you doin'?
Hey.
Mm. Oh, no, Rick. What did you guys do to us?
I think you did it to yourself.
I know what you mean, Morty, but I can't help you get over there.
What? What kind of monster would do that?
We're not them! We're not THEM! We just got them back!
They're not robots, Rick! They're human!
We never left either, Morty!
But... but they're robots!
I never left the Blender Dimension 34, Morty
They disintegrated the entire Blender class!
Holy shit!
