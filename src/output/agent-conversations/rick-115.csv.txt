What's up Rick!
Uh, what's up Morty?
Uh oh, here we go!
What's going on, Rick?
What are you doing?
I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
I'm not letting him out.
He's an animal. He's not a human. He has no rights.
We'll take him, Jerry. You have to take him.
Jerry, take him off!
He turned himself in on purpose!
We didn't take him back! He's a terrorist! We captured him and he's coming for you!
Please don't leave me again, Morty. I'm so sorry.
What? What kind of monster are you? A competent one.
Who cares how stupid you are? Just hold me.
Hold me. I need medical attention.
You're a monster.
I-I-Is this the Vindibeacon?
Rick, you're a terrorist.
No, you don't!
Jerry?
