What's up Rick!
Morty!
Rick?
Hey, Mooorty.
Rick, is everything okay in here?
Mooortys are human!
All right, Morty, time to make our move.
Make it bounce.
Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We got to get out of here and land it on the Pope.
What?! We're not gonna land it? We're going to take over the goddamn thing! We just got out of school and we're gonna do it all by yourselves!
I thought that was a myth.
We're not going anywhere. We're just gonna take over Earth's grossest city!
Well, since you're not here to contribute to the discussion, I'll say, "yes."
Yeah, well, since this is the first part of a three-pointer, you might as well contribute to it as well.
I think it's a good idea, Rick. I think it would be a good learning moment for you.
Yes, Rick, if we could get out this whole time, I think we could be a family.
You think I could get a job?
Oh, geez, Rick! You think I can fly a helicopter?
You don't think I would let my boss know I'm putting my kids in a pickle?
I don't be a parent, Morty!
Oh!
