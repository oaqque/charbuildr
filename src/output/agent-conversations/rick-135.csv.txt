What's up Rick!
I told ya not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
Why not?
He's dead.
He turned himself in on purpose.
Did he turn himself in?
Yes. Yes he did.
Wait, wait, who said that?
Who said that!
It's a figure of speech, Morty. You don't have to worry about it. Just do the same thing over and over again, expecting different things.
I don't care about the end, Morty! I want the big head! I'm gonna put it right back! And I'm going to go find Mom and Dad.
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh. Oh, man, ohh! Oh! Ohh!
Ohh! He turned himself into a pickle!
Morty, do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty?
I think we're about to reach the top of the food chain, Morty
What? What kind of God lets a pickled deer enter a nursing home?
Well, I think it's possible that the deer's more intelligent than you think, and therefore, you're more likely to have a greater chance of actually getting to know the deer than the fruit.
That's a three-pointer!
That is one-hit!
What the hell?
You're kidding me?!
