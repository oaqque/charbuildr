What's up Rick!
What's this place?
It's a trap!
Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here!
I don't know what to say. We're gonna be fine! We're goners! We got families, man! We have families, Morty!
Whoa! Hey there, stranger. What you guys got going on there?
We're just hanging out and stuff. You guys doin' really good chemistry.
We just stumbled upon a comet. Pretty cool stuff, Morty
What the hell?
Well, duh doy, Morty, it's a comet!
Look, I know it's not the prettiest comet in the galaxy, but I thought, Hey, hey, why not swing by where the comet is?
Hey, Rick, can you, uh  please let me out of this crate?
Uh, can we get outta here?
Oh, absolutely. We'll be in your waiting room.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, that's absolutely ridiculous. You know, I mean, that isn't funny, you know?
Come get this delicious brine.
Yeah.
That's pretty crazy. You should see a doctor.
I'm not joking, that man, that lady is absolutely insane.
Oh my God! Oh, my God, my head.
